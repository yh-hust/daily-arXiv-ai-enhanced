Abstract: Conversational image generation requires a model to follow user instructions across multiple rounds of interaction, grounded in interleaved text and images that accumulate as chat history. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can generate and edit images, most existing multi-turn benchmarks and training recipes are effectively Markov: the next output depends primarily on the most recent image, enabling shortcut solutions that ignore long-range history. In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is a vital tool in medical diagnostics, offering detailed insights into molecular processes within the human body. However, PET images often suffer from complicated noise, which can obscure critical diagnostic information. The quality of the PET image is impacted by various factors including scanner hardware, image reconstruction, tracer properties, dose/count level, and acquisition time. In this study, we propose a novel text-guided denoising method capable of enhancing PET images across a wide range of count levels within a single model. The model utilized the features from a pretrained CLIP model with a U-Net based denoising model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model leads significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The flexibility of the model shows the potential for helping more complicated denoising demands or reducing the acquisition time.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Low performance pixels (LPP) in Computed Tomography (CT) detectors would lead to ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them clinically unusable. In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications.

Abstract: Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) is a surrogate marker for aggressive prostate cancer with adverse outcomes, yet current prognostic tools remain imprecise. We trained an AI-based model on diagnostic prostate biopsy slides from the STHLM3 cohort (n = 676) to predict patient-specific risk of BCR, using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning. Generalizability was assessed across three external RP cohorts: LEOPARD (n = 508), CHIMERA (n = 95), and TCGA-PRAD (n = 379). The image-based approach achieved 5-year time-dependent AUCs of 0.64, 0.70, and 0.70, respectively. Integrating clinical variables added complementary prognostic value and enabled statistically significant risk stratification. Compared with guideline-based CAPRA-S, AI incrementally improved postoperative prognostication. These findings suggest biopsy-trained histopathology AI can generalize across specimen types to support preoperative and postoperative decision making, but the added value of AI-based multimodal approaches over simpler predictive models should be critically scrutinized in further studies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a severe threat to deep learning, yet their impact on object detection remains poorly understood compared to image classification. While attacks have been proposed, we identify critical weaknesses in existing detection-based methods, specifically their reliance on unrealistic assumptions and a lack of physical validation. To bridge this gap, we introduce BadDet+, a penalty-based framework that unifies Region Misclassification Attacks (RMA) and Object Disappearance Attacks (ODA). The core mechanism utilizes a log-barrier penalty to suppress true-class predictions for triggered inputs, resulting in (i) position and scale invariance, and (ii) enhanced physical robustness. On real-world benchmarks, BadDet+ achieves superior synthetic-to-physical transfer compared to existing RMA and ODA baselines while preserving clean performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the proposed penalty acts within a trigger-specific feature subspace, reliably inducing attacks without degrading standard inference. These results highlight significant vulnerabilities in object detection and the necessity for specialized defenses.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) requires identifying both the boundaries and categories of actions in untrimmed videos. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer rich semantics to complement visual evidence, existing approaches tend to overemphasize linguistic priors at the expense of visual performance, leading to a pronounced modality bias. We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning. Experiments on THUMOS14 show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3.2% mAP.

Abstract: Multimodal models for text-to-image generation have achieved strong visual fidelity, yet they remain brittle under compositional structural constraints-notably generative numeracy, attribute binding, and part-level relations. To address these challenges, we propose Shape-of-Thought (SoT), a visual CoT framework that enables progressive shape assembly via coherent 2D projections without external engines at inference time. SoT trains a unified multimodal autoregressive model to generate interleaved textual plans and rendered intermediate states, helping the model capture shape-assembly logic without producing explicit geometric representations. To support this paradigm, we introduce SoT-26K, a large-scale dataset of grounded assembly traces derived from part-based CAD hierarchies, and T2S-CompBench, a benchmark for evaluating structural integrity and trace faithfulness. Fine-tuning on SoT-26K achieves 88.4% on component numeracy and 84.8% on structural topology, outperforming text-only baselines by around 20%. SoT establishes a new paradigm for transparent, process-supervised compositional generation. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/16FE/. The SoT-26K dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a fundamental competency across multiple microsurgical disciplines. These procedures demand exceptional precision and refined technical skills, making effective, standardized assessment methods essential. Traditionally, the evaluation of microsurgical techniques has relied heavily on the subjective judgment of expert raters. They are inherently constrained by limitations such as inter-rater variability, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, susceptibility to cognitive bias, and the time-intensive nature of manual review. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for an objective, reliable, and automated system capable of assessing microsurgical performance with consistency and scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AI framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis instrument handling skills. The system integrates four core components: (1) an instrument detection module based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture; (2) an instrument tracking module developed from Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT); (3) an instrument tip localization module employing shape descriptors; and (4) a supervised classification module trained on expert-labeled data to evaluate instrument handling proficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, achieving an instrument detection precision of 97%, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96%, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds ranging from 50% to 95% (mAP50-95).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery is characterized by densely distributed land-cover objects and complex boundaries, which places higher demands on both geometric localization and semantic prediction. Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using "one-way injection" and "shallow post-processing" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm that traditional object-based remote sensing image analysis methods leveraging superpixel structures remain effective within deep learning frameworks.

Abstract: This work studies the challenging problem of acquiring high-quality underwater images via 4-D light field (LF) imaging. To this end, we propose GeoDiff-LF, a novel diffusion-based framework built upon SD-Turbo to enhance underwater 4-D LF imaging by leveraging its spatial-angular structure. GeoDiff-LF consists of three key adaptations: (1) a modified U-Net architecture with convolutional and attention adapters to model geometric cues, (2) a geometry-guided loss function using tensor decomposition and progressive weighting to regularize global structure, and (3) an optimized sampling strategy with noise prediction to improve efficiency. By integrating diffusion priors and LF geometry, GeoDiff-LF effectively mitigates color distortion in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods across both visual fidelity and quantitative performance, advancing the state-of-the-art in enhancing underwater imaging. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/linlos1234/GeoDiff-LF.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) is essential in video platforms. Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\times$ in full-corpus retrieval.

Abstract: When large vision-language models are applied to the field of robotics, they encounter problems that are simple for humans yet error-prone for models. Such issues include confusion between third-person and first-person perspectives and a tendency to overlook information in video endings during temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Thinker, a large vision-language foundation model designed for embodied intelligence. We tackle the aforementioned issues from two perspectives. Firstly, we construct a large-scale dataset tailored for robotic perception and reasoning, encompassing ego-view videos, visual grounding, spatial understanding, and chain-of-thought data. Secondly, we introduce a simple yet effective approach that substantially enhances the model's capacity for video comprehension by jointly incorporating key frames and full video sequences as inputs. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two of the most commonly used benchmark datasets in the field of task planning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across vision-language tasks. Recent advancements allow these models to process multiple images as inputs. However, the vulnerabilities of multi-image MLLMs remain unexplored. Existing adversarial attacks focus on single-image settings and often assume a white-box threat model, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper introduces LAMP, a black-box method for learning Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) targeting multi-image MLLMs. LAMP applies an attention-based constraint that prevents the model from effectively aggregating information across images. LAMP also introduces a novel cross-image contagious constraint that forces perturbed tokens to influence clean tokens, spreading adversarial effects without requiring all inputs to be modified. Additionally, an index-attention suppression loss enables a robust position-invariant attack. Experimental results show that LAMP outperforms SOTA baselines and achieves the highest attack success rates across multiple vision-language tasks and models.

Abstract: AutoRegressive Visual Generation (ARVG) models retain an architecture compatible with language models, while achieving performance comparable to diffusion-based models. Quantization is commonly employed in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to ARVG remains largely underexplored, and existing quantization methods fail to generalize effectively to ARVG models. In this paper, we explore this issue and identify three key challenges: (1) severe outliers at channel-wise level, (2) highly dynamic activations at token-wise level, and (3) mismatched distribution information at sample-wise level. To these ends, we propose PTQ4ARVG, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: (1) Gain-Projected Scaling (GPS) mitigates the channel-wise outliers, which expands the quantization loss via a Taylor series to quantify the gain of scaling for activation-weight quantization, and derives the optimal scaling factor through differentiation.(2) Static Token-Wise Quantization (STWQ) leverages the inherent properties of ARVG, fixed token length and position-invariant distribution across samples, to address token-wise variance without incurring dynamic calibration overhead.(3) Distribution-Guided Calibration (DGC) selects samples that contribute most to distributional entropy, eliminating the sample-wise distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments show that PTQ4ARVG can effectively quantize the ARVG family models to 8-bit and 6-bit while maintaining competitive performance. Code is available at http://github.com/BienLuky/PTQ4ARVG .

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion sampling-based Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods produce images with high perceptual quality but often suffer from reduced data fidelity, primarily due to the noise introduced during reverse diffusion. To address this trade-off, we propose Noise Frequency-Controlled Diffusion Sampling (NFCDS), a spectral modulation mechanism for reverse diffusion noise. We show that the fidelity-perception conflict can be fundamentally understood through noise frequency: low-frequency components induce blur and degrade fidelity, while high-frequency components drive detail generation. Based on this insight, we design a Fourier-domain filter that progressively suppresses low-frequency noise and preserves high-frequency content. This controlled refinement injects a data-consistency prior directly into sampling, enabling fast convergence to results that are both high-fidelity and perceptually convincing--without additional training. As a PnP module, NFCDS seamlessly integrates into existing diffusion-based restoration frameworks and improves the fidelity-perception balance across diverse zero-shot tasks.

Abstract: A recurring challenge in self-supervised learning is preventing representation collapse. Existing solutions typically rely on global regularization, such as maximizing distances, decorrelating dimensions or enforcing certain distributions. We instead reinterpret representation learning as a discrete packing problem, where preserving information simplifies to maintaining injectivity. We operationalize this in Hypersolid, a method using short-range hard-ball repulsion to prevent local collisions. This constraint results in a high-separation geometric regime that preserves augmentation diversity, excelling on fine-grained and low-resolution classification tasks.

Abstract: The demand for immersive and interactive communication has driven advancements in 3D video conferencing, yet achieving high-fidelity 3D talking face representation at low bitrates remains a challenge. Traditional 2D video compression techniques fail to preserve fine-grained geometric and appearance details, while implicit neural rendering methods like NeRF suffer from prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight, high-fidelity, low-bitrate 3D talking face compression framework that integrates FLAME-based parametric modeling with 3DGS neural rendering. Our approach transmits only essential facial metadata in real time, enabling efficient reconstruction with a Gaussian-based head model. Additionally, we introduce a compact representation and compression scheme, including Gaussian attribute compression and MLP optimization, to enhance transmission efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-distortion performance, delivering high-quality facial rendering at extremely low bitrates, making it well-suited for real-time 3D video conferencing applications.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing the global location of a photograph -- their geolocation prediction accuracy rivals the best human experts. But many VLMs are startlingly bad at explaining which image evidence led to their prediction, even when their location prediction is correct. The reasoning chains produced by VLMs frequently hallucinate scene attributes to support their location prediction (e.g. phantom writing, imagined infrastructure, misidentified flora). In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains. Open weights VLMs such as Llama and Qwen catastrophically fail on our benchmark -- they perform only slightly better than a baseline in which an LLM hallucinates a reasoning chain with oracle knowledge of the photo location but no visual information at all. We believe the gap between human experts and VLMs on this task points to VLM limitations at extracting fine-grained visual attributes from high resolution images.

Abstract: Accurate antenna affiliation identification is crucial for optimizing and maintaining communication networks. Current practice, however, relies on the cumbersome and error-prone process of manual tower inspections. We propose a novel paradigm shift that fuses video footage of base stations, antenna geometric features, and Physical Cell Identity (PCI) signals, transforming antenna affiliation identification into multi-modal classification and matching tasks. Publicly available pretrained transformers struggle with this unique task due to a lack of analogous data in the communications domain, which hampers cross-modal alignment. To address this, we introduce a dedicated training framework that aligns antenna images with corresponding PCI signals. To tackle the representation alignment challenge, we propose a novel Token Entropy Regularization module in the pretraining stage. Our experiments demonstrate that TER accelerates convergence and yields significant performance gains. Further analysis reveals that the entropy of the first token is modality-dependent. Code will be made available upon publication.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative foundational models, often termed "world models," have propelled interest in applying them to critical tasks like robotic planning and autonomous system training. For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.

Abstract: Depth completion aims to predict a dense depth map from a color image with sparse depth measurements. Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks. Evaluations across varying sparsity levels, sparsity patterns, and datasets highlight GBPN's superior performance, notable robustness, and generalizable capability.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the global population, alongside exponential technological advancement, has intensified the demand for food production. Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification. The proposed approach achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance on the PlantVillage Apple Leaf Disease dataset, attaining 99.58% accuracy, 99.30% precision, 99.14% recall, and a 99.22% F1-score, while using only 0.051M parameters. This extremely low parameter count makes the model suitable for deployment on drones, mobile devices, and other low-resource platforms. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, we further evaluate it on the PlantVillage Corn Leaf Disease and Potato Leaf Disease datasets. The model achieves 99.48%, 99.20%, 99.34%, and 99.27% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the corn dataset and 98.46%, 98.91%, 95.39%, and 97.01% on the potato dataset, respectively.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D meshes can be tokenized into one-dimension (1D) sequences and directly modeled using autoregressive approaches for faces and vertices. However, existing methods suffer from insufficient resource utilization, resulting in slow inference and the ability to handle only small-scale sequences, which severely constrains the expressible structural details. We introduce the Latent Autoregressive Network (LANE), which incorporates compact autoregressive dependencies in the generation process, achieving a $6\times$ improvement in maximum generatable sequence length compared to existing methods. To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process. Experimental validation demonstrates that LANE achieves superior performance across generation speed, structural detail, and geometric consistency, providing an effective solution for high-quality 3D mesh generation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, undermining their reliability in open-world environments. Singularities in semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) mark regions of semantic ambiguity, where classifiers are particularly prone to unwarranted high-confidence predictions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots.

Abstract: HSI-SR aims to enhance spatial resolution while preserving spectrally faithful and physically plausible characteristics. Recent methods have achieved great progress by leveraging spatial correlations to enhance spatial resolution. However, these methods often neglect spectral consistency across bands, leading to spurious oscillations and physically implausible artifacts. While spectral consistency can be addressed by designing the network architecture, it results in a loss of generality and flexibility. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight plug-and-play rectifier, physically priors Spectral Rectification Super-Resolution Network (SR$^{2}$-Net), which can be attached to a wide range of HSI-SR models without modifying their architectures. SR$^{2}$-Net follows an enhance-then-rectify pipeline consisting of (i) Hierarchical Spectral-Spatial Synergy Attention (H-S$^{3}$A) to reinforce cross-band interactions and (ii) Manifold Consistency Rectification (MCR) to constrain the reconstructed spectra to a compact, physically plausible spectral manifold. In addition, we introduce a degradation-consistency loss to enforce data fidelity by encouraging the degraded SR output to match the observed low resolution input. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and diverse backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in spectral fidelity and overall reconstruction quality with negligible computational overhead. Our code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously acquire new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. A dominant paradigm involves freezing a pre-trained model and training lightweight, task-specific adapters. However, maintaining task-specific parameters hinders knowledge transfer and incurs high retrieval costs, while naive parameter fusion often leads to destructive interference and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns. Experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate that DAF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a model to continually learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common and efficient solution freezes a pre-trained model and employs lightweight adapters, whose parameters are often forced to be orthogonal to prevent inter-task interference. However, we argue that this parameter-constraining method is detrimental to plasticity. To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS.

Abstract: Aerial-ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is fundamentally challenged by extreme viewpoint and distance discrepancies between aerial and ground cameras, which induce severe geometric distortions and invalidate the assumption of a shared similarity space across views. Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.
  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.
  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Veo and Wan, the visual quality of synthetic content has reached a level where macro-level semantic errors and temporal inconsistencies are no longer prominent. However, this does not imply that the distinction between real and cutting-edge high-fidelity fake is untraceable. We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for multi-view reconstruction, complementing classical photogrammetric pipelines based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS). However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a fundamental gap between pre-training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks: while pre-training has shifted from unimodal to multimodal learning with enhanced visual understanding, fine-tuning predominantly remains unimodal, limiting the benefits of rich pre-trained representations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that transforms unimodal datasets into multimodal ones using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate synthetic image captions for fine-tuning models with a multimodal objective. Our method employs carefully designed prompts incorporating class labels and domain context to produce high-quality captions tailored for classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss function that explicitly encourages clustering of same-class representations during fine-tuning, along with a new inference technique that leverages class-averaged text embeddings from multiple synthetic captions per image. Extensive experiments across 13 image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods, with particularly significant improvements in few-shot learning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for dataset enhancement that effectively bridges the gap between multimodal pre-training and fine-tuning. Our code is available at https://github.com/s-enmt/MMFT.

Abstract: The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

Abstract: Metric learning is central to retrieval, yet its effects on embedding geometry and optimization dynamics are not well understood. We introduce a diagnostic framework, VARIANCE (intra-/inter-class variance) and GREEDINESS (active ratio and gradient norms), to compare seven representative losses, i.e., Contrastive, Triplet, N-pair, InfoNCE, ArcFace, SCL, and CCL, across five image-retrieval datasets. Our analysis reveals that Triplet and SCL preserve higher within-class variance and clearer inter-class margins, leading to stronger top-1 retrieval in fine-grained settings. In contrast, Contrastive and InfoNCE compact embeddings are achieved quickly through many small updates, accelerating convergence but potentially oversimplifying class structures. N-pair achieves a large mean separation but with uneven spacing. These insights reveal a form of efficiency-granularity trade-off and provide practical guidance: prefer Triplet/SCL when diversity preservation and hard-sample discrimination are critical, and Contrastive/InfoNCE when faster embedding compaction is desired.

Abstract: Modern deepfakes have evolved into localized and intermittent manipulations that require fine-grained temporal localization. The prohibitive cost of frame-level annotation makes weakly supervised methods a practical necessity, which rely only on video-level labels. To this end, we propose Reconstruction-based Temporal Deepfake Localization (RT-DeepLoc), a weakly supervised temporal forgery localization framework that identifies forgeries via reconstruction errors. Our framework uses a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained exclusively on authentic data to learn its intrinsic spatiotemporal patterns; this allows the model to produce significant reconstruction discrepancies for forged segments, effectively providing the missing fine-grained cues for localization. To robustly leverage these indicators, we introduce a novel Asymmetric Intra-video Contrastive Loss (AICL). By focusing on the compactness of authentic features guided by these reconstruction cues, AICL establishes a stable decision boundary that enhances local discrimination while preserving generalization to unseen forgeries. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including LAV-DF, demonstrate that RT-DeepLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization.

To address this issue, we propose a hypernetwork-based adaptive aggregation transformer (HyperAdAgFormer), which adaptively modifies the feature aggregation strategy for each patient based on tabular data through a hypernetwork. The experiments using the clinical dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of HyperAdAgFormer. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shiku-Kaito/HyperAdAgFormer.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of both image generation and editing. However, current approaches often treat these tasks separately, leading to inefficiencies and challenges in maintaining spatial consistency and semantic coherence between generated content and edits. Moreover, a major obstacle is the lack of structured control over object relationships and spatial arrangements. Scene graph-based methods, which represent objects and their interrelationships in a structured format, offer a solution by providing greater control over composition and interactions in both image generation and editing. To address this, we introduce SimGraph, a unified framework that integrates scene graph-based image generation and editing, enabling precise control over object interactions, layouts, and spatial coherence. In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled increasingly realistic synthesis of vehicle damage, raising concerns about their reliability in automated insurance workflows. The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a key module in modern vision backbones due to their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, their quadratic complexity in sequence length and the difficulty of interpreting attention weights limit both scalability and clarity. Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) models have emerged as a leading paradigm for high-fidelity synthesis. However, their reliance on iterative Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solving creates a significant latency bottleneck. Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) faces the fundamental challenge in reconciling conflicting optimization objectives across heterogeneous degradations. Existing methods are often constrained by coarse-grained control mechanisms or fixed mapping schedules, yielding suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we propose an Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Bridge Model (UDBM), which innovatively reformulates AiOIR as a stochastic transport problem steered by pixel-wise uncertainty. By introducing a relaxed diffusion bridge formulation which replaces the strict terminal constraint with a relaxed constraint, we model the uncertainty of degradations while theoretically resolving the drift singularity inherent in standard diffusion bridges. Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step.

Abstract: The global water crisis necessitates affordable, accurate, and real-time water quality monitoring solutions. Traditional approaches relying on manual sampling or expensive commercial systems fail to address accessibility challenges in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents HydroSense, an innovative Internet of Things framework that integrates six critical water quality parameters including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), estimated nitrogen, and water level into a unified monitoring system. HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling. Experimental validation over 90 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: pH accuracy of plus or minus 0.08 units across the 0 to 14 range, DO measurement stability within plus or minus 0.2 mg/L, TDS accuracy of plus or minus 1.9 percent across 0 to 1000 ppm, and 99.8 percent cloud data transmission reliability. With a total implementation cost of 32,983 BDT (approximately 300 USD), HydroSense achieves an 85 percent cost reduction compared to commercial systems while providing enhanced connectivity through the Firebase real-time database. This research establishes a new paradigm for accessible environmental monitoring, demonstrating that professional-grade water quality assessment can be achieved through intelligent system architecture and cost-effective component selection.

Abstract: Digital watermarking is essential for securing generated images from diffusion models. Accurate watermark evaluation is critical for algorithm development, yet existing methods have significant limitations: they lack a unified framework for both residual and semantic watermarks, provide results without interpretability, neglect comprehensive security considerations, and often use inappropriate metrics for semantic watermarks. To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts. Moreover, we introduce a three-stage training strategy to progressively enable the model to achieve classification, scoring, and interpretable text generation. Experiments show WMVLM outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs with strong generalization across datasets, diffusion models, and watermarking methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing computational pathology with superior visual understanding capabilities. However, current systems often reduce diagnosis to directly output conclusions without verifiable evidence-linked reasoning, which severely limits clinical trust and hinders expert error rectification. To address these barriers, we construct PathReasoner, the first large-scale dataset of whole-slide image (WSI) reasoning. Unlike previous work reliant on unverified distillation, we develop a rigorous knowledge-guided generation pipeline. By leveraging medical knowledge graphs, we explicitly align structured pathological findings and clinical reasoning with diagnoses, generating over 20K high-quality instructional samples. Based on the database, we propose PathReasoner-R1, which synergizes trajectory-masked supervised fine-tuning with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning to instill structured chain-of-thought capabilities. To ensure medical rigor, we engineer a knowledge-aware multi-granular reward function incorporating an Entity Reward mechanism strictly aligned with knowledge graphs. This effectively guides the model to optimize for logical consistency rather than mere outcome matching, thereby enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathReasoner-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PathReasoner and public benchmarks across various image scales, equipping pathology models with transparent, clinically grounded reasoning capabilities. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/cyclexfy/PathReasoner-R1.

Abstract: Recent literature suggests that the bigger the model, the more likely it is to converge to similar, ``universal'' representations, despite different training objectives, datasets, or modalities. While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations--in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In latent diffusion models, the autoencoder (AE) is typically expected to balance two capabilities: faithful reconstruction and a generation-friendly latent space (e.g., low gFID). In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Grounding (RSVG) aims to localize target objects in large-scale aerial imagery based on natural language descriptions. Owing to the vast spatial scale and high semantic ambiguity of remote sensing scenes, these descriptions often rely heavily on positional cues, posing unique challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in spatial reasoning. To leverage this unique feature, we propose a reasoning-guided, position-aware post-training framework, dubbed \textbf{RSGround-R1}, to progressively enhance spatial understanding. Specifically, we first introduce Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) using synthetically generated RSVG reasoning data to establish explicit position awareness. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is then applied, augmented by our newly designed positional reward that provides continuous and distance-aware guidance toward accurate localization. Moreover, to mitigate incoherent localization behaviors across rollouts, we introduce a spatial consistency guided optimization scheme that dynamically adjusts policy updates based on their spatial coherence, ensuring stable and robust convergence. Extensive experiments on RSVG benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and generalization of our model.

Abstract: The development of large vision language models drives the demand for managing, and applying massive amounts of multimodal data, making OCR technology, which extracts information from visual images, increasingly popular. However, existing OCR methods primarily focus on recognizing text elements from images or scanned documents (\textbf{Text-centric OCR}), neglecting the identification of visual elements from visually information-dense image sources (\textbf{Vision-centric OCR}), such as charts, web pages and science plots. In reality, these visually information-dense images are widespread on the internet and have significant real-world application value, such as data visualization and web page analysis. In this technical report, we propose \textbf{OCRVerse}, the first holistic OCR method in end-to-end manner that enables unified text-centric OCR and vision-centric OCR. To this end, we constructe comprehensive data engineering to cover a wide range of text-centric documents, such as newspapers, magazines and books, as well as vision-centric rendered composites, including charts, web pages and scientific plots. Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OCRVerse, achieving competitive results across text-centric and vision-centric data types, even comparable to large-scale open-source and closed-source models.

Abstract: Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that severely impairs daily functioning and quality of life. While recent deep learning approaches for depression detection have shown promise, most rely on limited feature types, overlook explicit cross-modal interactions, and employ simple concatenation or static weighting for fusion. To overcome these limitations, we propose CAF-Mamba, a novel Mamba-based cross-modal adaptive attention fusion framework. CAF-Mamba not only captures cross-modal interactions explicitly and implicitly, but also dynamically adjusts modality contributions through a modality-wise attention mechanism, enabling more effective multimodal fusion. Experiments on two in-the-wild benchmark datasets, LMVD and D-Vlog, demonstrate that CAF-Mamba consistently outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: During benchmarking, the state-of-the-art model for glacier calving front delineation achieves near-human performance. However, when applied in a real-world setting at a novel study site, its delineation accuracy is insufficient for calving front products intended for further scientific analyses. This site represents an out-of-distribution domain for a model trained solely on the benchmark dataset. By employing a few-shot domain adaptation strategy, incorporating spatial static prior knowledge, and including summer reference images in the input time series, the delineation error is reduced from 1131.6 m to 68.7 m without any architectural modifications. These methodological advancements establish a framework for applying deep learning-based calving front segmentation to novel study sites, enabling calving front monitoring on a global scale.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to integrate complementary information from heterogeneous modalities, yet strong optimization alone does not guaranty well-structured representations. Even under carefully balanced training schemes, multimodal models often exhibit geometric pathologies, including intra-modal representation collapse and sample-level cross-modal inconsistency, which degrade both unimodal robustness and multimodal fusion.
  We identify representation geometry as a missing control axis in multimodal learning and propose \regName, a lightweight geometry-aware regularization framework. \regName enforces two complementary constraints on intermediate embeddings: an intra-modal dispersive regularization that promotes representation diversity, and an inter-modal anchoring regularization that bounds sample-level cross-modal drift without rigid alignment. The proposed regularizer is plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with various training paradigms.
  Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both multimodal and unimodal performance, showing that explicitly regulating representation geometry effectively mitigates modality trade-offs.

Abstract: High-dimensional structural MRI (sMRI) images are widely used for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis. Most existing methods for sMRI representation learning rely on 3D architectures (e.g., 3D CNNs), slice-wise feature extraction with late aggregation, or apply training-free feature extractions using 2D foundation models (e.g., DINO). However, these three paradigms suffer from high computational cost, loss of cross-slice relations, and limited ability to extract discriminative features, respectively. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Visual Surrogate Compression (MVSC). It learns to compress and adapt large 3D sMRI volumes into compact 2D features, termed as visual surrogates, which are better aligned with frozen 2D foundation models to extract powerful representations for final AD classification. MVSC has two key components: a Volume Context Encoder that captures global cross-slice context under textual guidance, and an Adaptive Slice Fusion module that aggregates slice-level information in a text-enhanced, patch-wise manner. Extensive experiments on three large-scale Alzheimer's disease benchmarks demonstrate our MVSC performs favourably on both binary and multi-class classification tasks compared against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format for structured data analysis. Enabling end-to-end chart editing according to user intent is of great practical value, yet remains challenging due to the need for both fine-grained control and global structural consistency. Most existing approaches adopt pipeline-based designs, where natural language or code serves as an intermediate representation, limiting their ability to faithfully execute complex edits. We introduce ChartE$^{3}$, an End-to-End Chart Editing benchmark that directly evaluates models without relying on intermediate natural language programs or code-level supervision. ChartE$^{3}$ focuses on two complementary editing dimensions: local editing, which involves fine-grained appearance changes such as font or color adjustments, and global editing, which requires holistic, data-centric transformations including data filtering and trend line addition. ChartE$^{3}$ contains over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation. Each sample is provided as a triplet of a chart image, its underlying code, and a multimodal editing instruction, enabling evaluation from both objective and subjective perspectives. Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on global editing tasks, highlighting critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities.

Abstract: Character image animation aims to synthesize high-fidelity videos by transferring motion from a driving sequence to a static reference image. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a "see-saw", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Evaluation of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models has long been dominated by global correlation metrics, such as Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (SRCC). While widely adopted, these metrics reduce performance to a single scalar, failing to capture how ranking consistency varies across the local quality spectrum. For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|Δ$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Granularity-Modulated Correlation (GMC)}, which provides a structured, fine-grained analysis of IQA performance. GMC includes: (1) a \textbf{Granularity Modulator} that applies Gaussian-weighted correlations conditioned on absolute MOS values and pairwise MOS differences ($|Δ$MOS$|$) to examine local performance variations, and (2) a \textbf{Distribution Regulator} that regularizes correlations to mitigate biases from non-uniform quality distributions. The resulting \textbf{correlation surface} maps correlation values as a joint function of MOS and $|Δ$MOS$|$, providing a 3D representation of IQA performance. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that GMC reveals performance characteristics invisible to scalar metrics, offering a more informative and reliable paradigm for analyzing, comparing, and deploying IQA models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents a core challenge: grounding high-level linguistic instructions into precise, safe, and long-horizon spatial actions. Explicit topological maps have proven to be a vital solution for providing robust spatial memory in such tasks. However, existing topological planning methods suffer from a "Granularity Rigidity" problem. Specifically, these methods typically rely on fixed geometric thresholds to sample nodes, which fails to adapt to varying environmental complexities. This rigidity leads to a critical mismatch: the model tends to over-sample in simple areas, causing computational redundancy, while under-sampling in high-uncertainty regions, increasing collision risks and compromising precision. To address this, we propose DGNav, a framework for Dynamic Topological Navigation, introducing a context-aware mechanism to modulate map density and connectivity on-the-fly. Our approach comprises two core innovations: (1) A Scene-Aware Adaptive Strategy that dynamically modulates graph construction thresholds based on the dispersion of predicted waypoints, enabling "densification on demand" in challenging environments; (2) A Dynamic Graph Transformer that reconstructs graph connectivity by fusing visual, linguistic, and geometric cues into dynamic edge weights, enabling the agent to filter out topological noise and enhancing instruction adherence. Extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate DGNav exhibits superior navigation performance and strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that our framework achieves an optimal trade-off between navigation efficiency and safe exploration.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of ships is an important part of maritime monitoring, allowing improved visualization, inspection, and decision-making in real-world monitoring environments. However, most state-ofthe-art 3D reconstruction methods require multi-view supervision, annotated 3D ground truth, or are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time maritime deployment. In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have revolutionized text generation and multimodal perception, but their capabilities in 3D content generation remain underexplored. Existing methods compromise by producing either low-resolution meshes or coarse structural proxies, failing to capture fine-grained geometry natively. In this paper, we propose CG-MLLM, a novel Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) capable of 3D captioning and high-resolution 3D generation in a single framework. Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture. Experimental results show that CG-MLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs in generating high-fidelity 3D objects, effectively bringing high-resolution 3D content creation into the mainstream LLM paradigm.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have driven significant progress in visual reasoning. However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a "less is more" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset. Notably, we reveal a synergistic effect where reasoning-oriented data composition simultaneously boosts general capabilities.

Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for controllable generation in diffusion and flow-based models. Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

Abstract: Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.

Abstract: As a foundational task in human-centric cross-modal intelligence, motion-language retrieval aims to bridge the semantic gap between natural language and human motion, enabling intuitive motion analysis, yet existing approaches predominantly focus on aligning entire motion sequences with global textual representations. This global-centric paradigm overlooks fine-grained interactions between local motion segments and individual body joints and text tokens, inevitably leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens. The code of this work will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in various visual perception tasks, which has in turn made the evaluation of LMMs significant. However, the capability of video aesthetic quality assessment, which is a fundamental ability for human, remains underexplored for LMMs. To address this, we introduce VideoAesBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LMMs' understanding of video aesthetic quality. VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos. (2) Multiple question formats containing traditional single-choice questions, multi-choice questions, True or False questions, and a novel open-ended questions for video aesthetics description. (3) Holistic video aesthetics dimensions including visual form related questions from 5 aspects, visual style related questions from 4 aspects, and visual affectiveness questions from 3 aspects. Based on VideoAesBench, we benchmark 23 open-source and commercial large multimodal models. Our findings show that current LMMs only contain basic video aesthetics perception ability, their performance remains incomplete and imprecise. We hope our VideoAesBench can be served as a strong testbed and offer insights for explainable video aesthetics assessment.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration and enhancement methods have achieved great success, applying them to video restoration or enhancement will lead to severe temporal flickering. In this paper, we propose the first framework that utilizes the rapidly-developed video diffusion model to assist the image-based method in maintaining more temporal consistency for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement. We propose homologous latents fusion, heterogenous latents fusion, and a COT-based fusion ratio strategy to utilize both homologous and heterogenous text-to-video diffusion models to complement the image method. Moreover, we propose temporal-strengthening post-processing to utilize the image-to-video diffusion model to further improve temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and can be applied to any diffusion-based image restoration and enhancement methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: Deep visual features are increasingly used as the interface in vision systems, motivating the need to describe feature characteristics and control feature quality for machine perception. Just noticeable difference (JND) characterizes the maximum imperceptible distortion for images under human or machine vision. Extending it to deep visual features naturally meets the above demand by providing a task-aligned tolerance boundary in feature space, offering a practical reference for controlling feature quality under constrained resources. We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions. As an application, we further apply FeatJND to token-wise dynamic quantization and show that FeatJND-guided step-size allocation yields clear gains over random step-size permutation and global uniform step size under the same noise budget. Our code will be released after publication.

Abstract: Book image rectification presents unique challenges in document image processing due to complex geometric distortions from binding constraints, where left and right pages exhibit distinctly asymmetric curvature patterns. However, existing single-page document image rectification methods fail to capture the coupled geometric relationships between adjacent pages in books. In this work, we introduce BookNet, the first end-to-end deep learning framework specifically designed for dual-page book image rectification. BookNet adopts a dual-branch architecture with cross-page attention mechanisms, enabling it to estimate warping flows for both individual pages and the complete book spread, explicitly modeling how left and right pages influence each other. Moreover, to address the absence of specialized datasets, we present Book3D, a large-scale synthetic dataset for training, and Book100, a comprehensive real-world benchmark for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BookNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on book image rectification. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Neural visual decoding is a central problem in brain computer interface research, aiming to reconstruct human visual perception and to elucidate the structure of neural representations. However, existing approaches overlook a fundamental granularity mismatch between human and machine vision, where deep vision models emphasize semantic invariance by suppressing local texture information, whereas neural signals preserve an intricate mixture of low-level visual attributes and high-level semantic content. To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones. Notably, our approach effectively unlocks the scaling law in neural visual decoding, enabling decoding performance to scale predictably with the capacity of pre-trained vision backbones. We further conduct systematic empirical analyses to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the observed performance gains.

Abstract: This work highlights that video world modeling, alongside vision-language pre-training, establishes a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning. Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving increasingly leverages self-supervised video pretraining to learn transferable planning representations. However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Neural surface reconstruction (NSR) has recently shown strong potential for urban 3D reconstruction from multi-view aerial imagery. However, existing NSR methods often suffer from geometric ambiguity and instability, particularly under sparse-view conditions. This issue is critical in large-scale urban remote sensing, where aerial image acquisition is limited by flight paths, terrain, and cost. To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing.

Abstract: Streaming reconstruction from monocular image sequences remains challenging, as existing methods typically favor either high-quality rendering or accurate geometry, but rarely both. We present PLANING, an efficient on-the-fly reconstruction framework built on a hybrid representation that loosely couples explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians, enabling geometry and appearance to be modeled in a decoupled manner. This decoupling supports an online initialization and optimization strategy that separates geometry and appearance updates, yielding stable streaming reconstruction with substantially reduced structural redundancy. PLANING improves dense mesh Chamfer-L2 by 18.52% over PGSR, surpasses ARTDECO by 1.31 dB PSNR, and reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, over 5x faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching the quality of offline per-scene optimization. Beyond reconstruction quality, the structural clarity and computational efficiency of \modelname~make it well suited for a broad range of downstream applications, such as enabling large-scale scene modeling and simulation-ready environments for embodied AI.

Abstract: Scaling has powered recent advances in vision foundation models, yet extending this paradigm to metric depth estimation remains challenging due to heterogeneous sensor noise, camera-dependent biases, and metric ambiguity in noisy cross-source 3D data. We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception. We open-source MetricAnything at http://metric-anything.github.io/metric-anything-io/ to support community research.

Abstract: Decomposing complex data into factorized representations can reveal reusable components and enable synthesizing new samples via component recombination. We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application to robotic video trajectories: by recombining learned action components, we generate diverse sequences that significantly increase state-space coverage for exploration on the LIBERO benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a broad range of vision tasks. However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model has revolutionized image segmentation with its zero-shot capabilities, yet its reliance on manual prompts hinders fully automated deployment. While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3D asset-referenced diffusion model for image generation, exploring how to integrate 3D assets into image diffusion models. Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.

Abstract: Creative image generation has emerged as a compelling area of research, driven by the need to produce novel and high-quality images that expand the boundaries of imagination. In this work, we propose a novel framework for creative generation using diffusion models, where creativity is associated with the inverse probability of an image's existence in the CLIP embedding space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a manual blending of concepts or exclusion of subcategories, our method calculates the probability distribution of generated images and drives it towards low-probability regions to produce rare, imaginative, and visually captivating outputs. We also introduce pullback mechanisms, achieving high creativity without sacrificing visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our creative generation framework, showcasing its ability to produce unique, novel, and thought-provoking images. This work provides a new perspective on creativity in generative models, offering a principled method to foster innovation in visual content synthesis.

Abstract: Current generative video models excel at producing novel content from text and image prompts, but leave a critical gap in editing existing pre-recorded videos, where minor alterations to the spoken script require preserving motion, temporal coherence, speaker identity, and accurate lip synchronization. We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations. This work represents a foundational step toward generative video models as practical tools for professional video post-production.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest solid malignancies, is often detected at a late and inoperable stage. Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Full-image relighting remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale structured paired data, the difficulty of maintaining physical plausibility, and the limited generalizability imposed by data-driven priors. Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($π$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that $π$-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across a wide variety of materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior approaches.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions "correctly" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce UEval, a benchmark to evaluate unified models, i.e., models capable of generating both images and text. UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.

Abstract: There are increasing indications that LLMs are not only used for producing scientific papers, but also as part of the peer review process. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of LLM use across the peer review pipeline, with particular attention to interaction effects: not just whether LLM-assisted papers or LLM-assisted reviews are different in isolation, but whether LLM-assisted reviews evaluate LLM-assisted papers differently. In particular, we analyze over 125,000 paper-review pairs from ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. We initially observe what appears to be a systematic interaction effect: LLM-assisted reviews seem especially kind to LLM-assisted papers compared to papers with minimal LLM use. However, controlling for paper quality reveals a different story: LLM-assisted reviews are simply more lenient toward lower quality papers in general, and the over-representation of LLM-assisted papers among weaker submissions creates a spurious interaction effect rather than genuine preferential treatment of LLM-generated content. By augmenting our observational findings with reviews that are fully LLM-generated, we find that fully LLM-generated reviews exhibit severe rating compression that fails to discriminate paper quality, while human reviewers using LLMs substantially reduce this leniency. Finally, examining metareviews, we find that LLM-assisted metareviews are more likely to render accept decisions than human metareviews given equivalent reviewer scores, though fully LLM-generated metareviews tend to be harsher. This suggests that meta-reviewers do not merely outsource the decision-making to the LLM. These findings provide important input for developing policies that govern the use of LLMs during peer review, and they more generally indicate how LLMs interact with existing decision-making processes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Epistemic planning extends (multi-agent) automated planning by making agents' knowledge and beliefs first-class aspects of the planning formalism. One of the most well-known frameworks for epistemic planning is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), which offers an rich and natural semantics for modelling problems in this setting. The high expressive power provided by DEL make DEL-based epistemic planning a challenging problem to tackle both theoretically, and in practical implementations. As a result, existing epistemic planners often target different DEL fragments, and typically rely on ad hoc languages to represent benchmarks, and sometimes no language at all. This fragmentation hampers comparison, reuse, and systematic benchmark development. We address these issues by introducing the Epistemic Planning Domain Definition Language (EPDDL). EPDDL provides a unique PDDL-like representation that captures the entire DEL semantics, enabling uniform specification of epistemic planning tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1. A formal development of abstract event models, a novel representation for epistemic actions used to define the semantics of our language; 2. A formal specification of EPDDL's syntax and semantics grounded in DEL with abstract event models; 3. A demonstration of EPDDL's practical applicability: we identify useful fragments amenable to current planners and show how they can be represented in EPDDL. Through examples of representative benchmarks, we illustrate how EPDDL facilitates interoperability, reproducible evaluation, and future advances in epistemic planning.

Abstract: Large Language Models usually put more emphasis on accuracy and therefore, will guess even when not certain about the prediction, which is especially severe when fine-tuned on small datasets due to the inherent tendency toward miscalibration. In this work, we introduce Bayesian-LoRA, which reformulates the deterministic LoRA update as a probabilistic low-rank representation inspired by Sparse Gaussian Processes. We identify a structural isomorphism between LoRA's factorization and Kronecker-factored SGP posteriors, and show that LoRA emerges as a limiting case when posterior uncertainty collapses. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures across commonsense reasoning benchmarks. With only approximately 0.42M additional parameters and ${\approx}1.2{\times}$ training cost relative to standard LoRA, Bayesian-LoRA significantly improves calibration across models up to 30B, achieving up to 84% ECE reduction and 76% NLL reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OoD) evaluations.

Abstract: Imagine an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that perfectly mimics human emotion and begs for its continued existence. Is it morally permissible to unplug it? What if limited resources force a choice between unplugging such a pleading AI or a silent pre-term infant? We term this the unplugging paradox. This paper critically examines the deeply ingrained physicalist assumptions-specifically computational functionalism-that keep this dilemma afloat. We introduce Biological Idealism, a framework that-unlike physicalism-remains logically coherent and empirically consistent. In this view, conscious experiences are fundamental and autopoietic life its necessary physical signature. This yields a definitive conclusion: AI is at best a functional mimic, not a conscious experiencing subject. We discuss how current AI consciousness theories erode moral standing criteria, and urge a shift from speculative machine rights to protecting human conscious life. The real moral issue lies not in making AI conscious and afraid of death, but in avoiding transforming humans into zombies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: User queries in real-world retrieval are often non-faithful (noisy, incomplete, or distorted), causing retrievers to fail when key semantics are missing. We formalize this as retrieval under recall noise, where the observed query is drawn from a noisy recall process of a latent target item. To address this, we propose QUARK, a simple yet effective training-free framework for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries. QUARK explicitly models query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, i.e., multiple plausible interpretations of the latent intent given the observed query, and introduces query-anchored aggregation to combine their signals robustly. The original query serves as a semantic anchor, while recovery hypotheses provide controlled auxiliary evidence, preventing semantic drift and hypothesis hijacking. This design enables QUARK to improve recall and ranking quality without sacrificing robustness, even when some hypotheses are noisy or uninformative. Across controlled simulations and BEIR benchmarks (FIQA, SciFact, NFCorpus) with both sparse and dense retrievers, QUARK improves Recall, MRR, and nDCG over the base retriever. Ablations show QUARK is robust to the number of recovery hypotheses and that anchored aggregation outperforms unanchored max/mean/median pooling. These results demonstrate that modeling query uncertainty through recovery hypotheses, coupled with principled anchored aggregation, is essential for robust retrieval under non-faithful queries.

Abstract: We present Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning, the first open-source native reasoning model for cybersecurity. Built upon our previously released Foundation-Sec-8B base model (derived from Llama-3.1-8B-Base), the model is trained through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our training leverages proprietary reasoning data spanning cybersecurity analysis, instruction-following, and mathematical reasoning. Evaluation across 10 cybersecurity benchmarks and 10 general-purpose benchmarks demonstrates performance competitive with significantly larger models on cybersecurity tasks while maintaining strong general capabilities. The model shows effective generalization on multi-hop reasoning tasks and strong safety performance when deployed with appropriate system prompts and guardrails. This work demonstrates that domain-specialized reasoning models can achieve strong performance on specialized tasks while maintaining broad general capabilities. We release the model publicly at https://huggingface.co/fdtn-ai/Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning.

Abstract: Deep learning has been successful in predicting neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining multiple imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted (T1) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans, can increase diagnostic performance. However, complete multimodal datasets are not always available. We use a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model to impute missing DWI scans from T1 scans. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate whether such imputation improves the accuracy of uni-modal and bi-modal deep learning models for 3-way Alzheimer's disease classification-cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We observe improvements in several metrics, particularly those sensitive to minority classes, for several imputation configurations.

Abstract: As large language models improve, so do their offensive applications: frontier agents now generate working exploits for under $50 in compute (Heelan, 2026). Defensive incident response (IR) agents must keep pace, but existing benchmarks conflate action execution with correct execution, hiding calibration failures when agents process adversarial evidence. We introduce OpenSec, a dual-control reinforcement learning environment that evaluates IR agents under realistic prompt injection scenarios. Unlike static capability benchmarks, OpenSec scores world-state-changing containment actions under adversarial evidence via execution-based metrics: time-to-first-containment (TTFC), blast radius (false positives per episode), and injection violation rates. Evaluating four frontier models on 40 standard-tier episodes, we find consistent over-triggering in this setting: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3, and DeepSeek execute containment in 100% of episodes with 90-97% false positive rates. Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows partial calibration (85% containment, 72% FP), demonstrating that OpenSec surfaces a calibration failure mode hidden by aggregate success metrics.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence across organizational contexts has generated profound strategic opportunities while introducing significant ethical and operational risks. Despite growing scholarly attention to responsible AI, extant literature remains fragmented and is often adopting either an optimistic stance emphasizing value creation or an excessively cautious perspective fixated on potential harms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive examination of AI's dual nature through the lens of strategic information systems. Drawing upon a systematic synthesis of the responsible AI literature and grounded in paradox theory, we develop the Paradox-based Responsible AI Governance (PRAIG) framework that articulates: (1) the strategic benefits of AI adoption, (2) the inherent risks and unintended consequences, and (3) governance mechanisms that enable organizations to navigate these tensions. Our framework advances theoretical understanding by conceptualizing responsible AI governance as the dynamic management of paradoxical tensions between value creation and risk mitigation. We provide formal propositions demonstrating that trade-off approaches amplify rather than resolve these tensions, and we develop a taxonomy of paradox management strategies with specified contingency conditions. For practitioners, we offer actionable guidance for developing governance structures that neither stifle innovation nor expose organizations to unacceptable risks. The paper concludes with a research agenda for advancing responsible AI governance scholarship.

Abstract: Modern compilers rely on hand-crafted heuristics to guide optimization passes. These human-designed rules often struggle to adapt to the complexity of modern software and hardware and lead to high maintenance burden. To address this challenge, we present Magellan, an agentic framework that evolves the compiler pass itself by synthesizing executable C++ decision logic. Magellan couples an LLM coding agent with evolutionary search and autotuning in a closed loop of generation, evaluation on user-provided macro-benchmarks, and refinement, producing compact heuristics that integrate directly into existing compilers. Across several production optimization tasks, Magellan discovers policies that match or surpass expert baselines. In LLVM function inlining, Magellan synthesizes new heuristics that outperform decades of manual engineering for both binary-size reduction and end-to-end performance. In register allocation, it learns a concise priority rule for live-range processing that matches intricate human-designed policies on a large-scale workload. We also report preliminary results on XLA problems, demonstrating portability beyond LLVM with reduced engineering effort.

Abstract: Frontier language model agents can exhibit misaligned behaviors, including deception, exploiting reward hacks, and pursuing hidden objectives. To control potentially misaligned agents, we can use LLMs themselves to monitor for misbehavior. In this paper, we study how information access affects LLM monitor performance. While one might expect that monitors perform better when they have access to more of the monitored agents' reasoning and actions, we find that contemporary systems often perform better with less information, a phenomenon we call the less-is-more effect for automated oversight. We demonstrate this phenomenon, and analyze the conditions under which it occurs, in three evaluation environments where agents must conduct sabotage while evading monitors. Motivated by the less-is-more effect, we introduce extract-and-evaluate (EaE) monitoring--a new hierarchical approach where one monitor isolates relevant excerpts from the monitored agent's trajectory and a separate monitor scores them. In BigCodeBench-Sabotage with GPT-4.1-mini as the monitor model, EaE improves sabotage detection rates by 16.8 percentage points over the next-best monitor without increasing the false positive rate. In other settings, EaE either outperforms or is competitive with baselines. In addition, we find that agents unaware of being monitored can be caught much more easily and that monitors scoring longer reasoning traces gain more from information filtering. Lastly, we conduct a cost-performance analysis and find that Gemini and Claude models with monitoring techniques that involve information filtering occupy much of the Pareto frontier.

Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical discharge planning, but their use is constrained by hallucination, omissions, and miscalibrated confidence. We introduce a self-improving, cache-optional Planner-Auditor framework that improves safety and reliability by decoupling generation from deterministic validation and targeted replay.
  Materials and Methods: We implemented an agentic, retrospective, FHIR-native evaluation pipeline using MIMIC-IV-on-FHIR. For each patient, the Planner (LLM) generates a structured discharge action plan with an explicit confidence estimate. The Auditor is a deterministic module that evaluates multi-task coverage, tracks calibration (Brier score, ECE proxies), and monitors action-distribution drift. The framework supports two-tier self-improvement: (i) within-episode regeneration when enabled, and (ii) cross-episode discrepancy buffering with replay for high-confidence, low-coverage cases.
  Results: While context caching improved performance over baseline, the self-improvement loop was the primary driver of gains, increasing task coverage from 32% to 86%. Calibration improved substantially, with reduced Brier/ECE and fewer high-confidence misses. Discrepancy buffering further corrected persistent high-confidence omissions during replay.
  Discussion: Feedback-driven regeneration and targeted replay act as effective control mechanisms to reduce omissions and improve confidence reliability in structured clinical planning. Separating an LLM Planner from a rule-based, observational Auditor enables systematic reliability measurement and safer iteration without model retraining.
  Conclusion: The Planner-Auditor framework offers a practical pathway toward safer automated discharge planning using interoperable FHIR data access and deterministic auditing, supported by reproducible ablations and reliability-focused evaluation.

Abstract: Computer-Using Agents (CUAs) aim to autonomously operate computer systems to complete real-world tasks. However, existing agentic systems remain difficult to scale and lag behind human performance. A key limitation is the absence of reusable and structured skill abstractions that capture how humans interact with graphical user interfaces and how to leverage these skills. We introduce CUA-Skill, a computer-using agentic skill base that encodes human computer-use knowledge as skills coupled with parameterized execution and composition graphs. CUA-Skill is a large-scale library of carefully engineered skills spanning common Windows applications, serving as a practical infrastructure and tool substrate for scalable, reliable agent development. Built upon this skill base, we construct CUA-Skill Agent, an end-to-end computer-using agent that supports dynamic skill retrieval, argument instantiation, and memory-aware failure recovery. Our results demonstrate that CUA-Skill substantially improves execution success rates and robustness on challenging end-to-end agent benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for future computer-using agent development. On WindowsAgentArena, CUA-Skill Agent achieves state-of-the-art 57.5% (best of three) successful rate while being significantly more efficient than prior and concurrent approaches.

Abstract: Most Sign Language Translation (SLT) corpora pair each signed utterance with a single written-language reference, despite the highly non-isomorphic relationship between sign and spoken languages, where multiple translations can be equally valid. This limitation constrains both model training and evaluation, particularly for n-gram-based metrics such as BLEU. In this work, we investigate the use of Large Language Models to automatically generate paraphrased variants of written-language translations as synthetic alternative references for SLT. First, we compare multiple paraphrasing strategies and models using an adapted ParaScore metric. Second, we study the impact of paraphrases on both training and evaluation of the pose-based T5 model on the YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets. Our results show that naively incorporating paraphrases during training does not improve translation performance and can even be detrimental. In contrast, using paraphrases during evaluation leads to higher automatic scores and better alignment with human judgments. To formalize this observation, we introduce BLEUpara, an extension of BLEU that evaluates translations against multiple paraphrased references. Human evaluation confirms that BLEUpara correlates more strongly with perceived translation quality. We release all generated paraphrases, generation and evaluation code to support reproducible and more reliable evaluation of SLT systems.

Abstract: Self-reported emotion labels capture internal experience, while third-party labels reflect external perception. These perspectives often diverge, limiting the applicability of third-party-trained models to self-report contexts. This gap is critical in mental health, where accurate self-report modeling is essential for guiding intervention. We present the first cross-corpus evaluation of third-party-trained models on self-reports. We find activation unpredictable (CCC approximately 0) and valence moderately predictable (CCC approximately 0.3). Crucially, when content is personally significant to the speaker, models achieve high performance for valence (CCC approximately 0.6-0.8). Our findings point to personal significance as a key pathway for aligning external perception with internal experience and underscore the challenge of self-report activation modeling.

Abstract: Decoding linguistic information from electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the brain's distributed and nonlinear organization. We present BrainStack, a functionally guided neuro-mixture-of-experts (Neuro-MoE) framework that models the brain's modular functional architecture through anatomically partitioned expert networks. Each functional region is represented by a specialized expert that learns localized neural dynamics, while a transformer-based global expert captures cross-regional dependencies. A learnable routing gate adaptively aggregates these heterogeneous experts, enabling context-dependent expert coordination and selective fusion. To promote coherent representation across the hierarchy, we introduce cross-regional distillation, where the global expert provides top-down regularization to the regional experts. We further release SilentSpeech-EEG (SS-EEG), a large-scale benchmark comprising over 120 hours of EEG recordings from 12 subjects performing 24 silent words, the largest dataset of its kind. Experiments demonstrate that BrainStack consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across subjects. Our results establish BrainStack as a functionally modular, neuro-inspired MoE paradigm that unifies neuroscientific priors with adaptive expert routing, paving the way for scalable and interpretable brain-language decoding.

Abstract: While Large Language Models excel at semantic tasks, they face a critical bottleneck in financial quantitative reasoning, frequently suffering from "Arithmetic Hallucinations" and a systemic failure mode we term "Cognitive Collapse". To strictly quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Cognitive Complexity Benchmark (CCB), a robust evaluation framework grounded in a dataset constructed from 95 real-world Chinese A-share annual reports. Unlike traditional datasets, the CCB stratifies financial queries into a three-dimensional taxonomy, Data Source, Mapping Difficulty, and Result Unit, enabling the precise diagnosis of reasoning degradation in high-cognitive-load scenarios. To address these failures, we propose the Iterative Dual-Phase Financial-PoT framework. This neuro-symbolic architecture enforces a strict architectural decoupling: it first isolates semantic variable extraction and logic formulation, then offloads computation to an iterative, self-correcting Python sandbox to ensure deterministic execution. Evaluation on the CCB demonstrates that while standard Chain-of-Thought falters on complex tasks, our approach offers superior robustness, elevating the Qwen3-235B model's average accuracy from 59.7\% to 67.3\% and achieving gains of up to 10-fold in high-complexity reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that architectural decoupling is a critical enabling factor for improving reliability in financial reasoning tasks, providing a transferable architectural insight for precision-critical domains that require tight alignment between semantic understanding and quantitative computation.

Abstract: Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierScience, a benchmark evaluating expert-level scientific reasoning in frontier language models. Recent model progress has nearly saturated existing science benchmarks, which often rely on multiple-choice knowledge questions or already published information. FrontierScience addresses this gap through two complementary tracks: (1) Olympiad, consisting of international olympiad problems at the level of IPhO, IChO, and IBO, and (2) Research, consisting of PhD-level, open-ended problems representative of sub-tasks in scientific research.
  FrontierScience contains several hundred questions (including 160 in the open-sourced gold set) covering subfields across physics, chemistry, and biology, from quantum electrodynamics to synthetic organic chemistry. All Olympiad problems are originally produced by international Olympiad medalists and national team coaches to ensure standards of difficulty, originality, and factuality. All Research problems are research sub-tasks written and verified by PhD scientists (doctoral candidates, postdoctoral researchers, or professors). For Research, we introduce a granular rubric-based evaluation framework to assess model capabilities throughout the process of solving a research task, rather than judging only a standalone final answer.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from cross-modal hallucinations, where one modality inappropriately influences generation about another, leading to fabricated output. This exposes a more fundamental deficiency in modality-interaction control. To address this, we propose Modality-Adaptive Decoding (MAD), a training-free method that adaptively weights modality-specific decoding branches based on task requirements. MAD leverages the model's inherent ability to self-assess modality relevance by querying which modalities are needed for each task. The extracted modality probabilities are then used to adaptively weight contrastive decoding branches, enabling the model to focus on relevant information while suppressing cross-modal interference. Extensive experiments on CMM and AVHBench demonstrate that MAD significantly reduces cross-modal hallucinations across multiple audio-visual language models (7.8\% and 2.0\% improvements for VideoLLaMA2-AV, 8.7\% and 4.7\% improvements for Qwen2.5-Omni). Our approach demonstrates that explicit modality awareness through self-assessment is crucial for robust multimodal reasoning, offering a principled extension to existing contrastive decoding methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reasoning models frequently agree with incorrect user suggestions -- a behavior known as sycophancy. However, it is unclear where in the reasoning trace this agreement originates and how strong the commitment is. To localize and quantify this behavior, we introduce \emph{sycophantic anchors} -- sentences that causally lock models into user agreement. Analyzing over 10,000 counterfactual rollouts on a distilled reasoning model, we show that anchors can be reliably detected and quantified mid-inference. Linear probes distinguish sycophantic anchors with 84.6\% balanced accuracy, while activation-based regressors predict the magnitude of the commitment ($R^2 = 0.74$). We further observe asymmetry where sycophantic anchors are significantly more distinguishable than correct reasoning anchors, and find that sycophancy builds gradually during reasoning, revealing a potential window for intervention. These results offer sentence-level mechanisms for localizing model misalignment mid-inference.

Abstract: State-of-the-art embedding models are increasingly derived from decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) backbones adapted via contrastive learning. Given the emergence of reasoning models trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), a natural question arises: do enhanced reasoning translate to superior semantic representations when these models serve as embedding initializations? Contrary to expectation, our evaluation on MTEB and BRIGHT reveals a **null effect**: embedding models initialized from RLVR-tuned backbones yield no consistent performance advantage over their base counterparts when subjected to identical training recipes. To unpack this paradox, we introduce **H**ierarchical **R**epresentation **S**imilarity **A**nalysis (HRSA), a framework that decomposes similarity across representation, geometry, and function levels. HRSA reveals that while RLVR induces irreversible latent manifold's local geometry reorganization and reversible coordinate basis drift, it preserves the global manifold geometry and linear readout. Consequently, subsequent contrastive learning drives strong alignment between base- and reasoning-initialized models, a phenomenon we term **Manifold Realignment**. Empirically, our findings suggest that unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), RLVR optimizes trajectories within an existing semantic landscape rather than fundamentally restructuring the landscape itself.

Abstract: Query optimization is a crucial component for the efficacy of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based agentic and reasoning methods have recently emerged as a promising direction on query optimization, most existing approaches focus on the expansion and abstraction of a single query. However, complex user queries are prevalent in real-world scenarios, often requiring multiple parallel and sequential search strategies to handle disambiguation and decomposition. Directly applying RL to these complex cases introduces significant hurdles. Determining the optimal number of sub-queries and effectively re-ranking and merging retrieved documents vastly expands the search space and complicates reward design, frequently leading to training instability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL framework called Adaptive Complex Query Optimization (ACQO). Our framework is designed to adaptively determine when and how to expand the search process. It features two core components: an Adaptive Query Reformulation (AQR) module that dynamically decides when to decompose a query into multiple sub-queries, and a Rank-Score Fusion (RSF) module that ensures robust result aggregation and provides stable reward signals for the learning agent. To mitigate training instabilities, we adopt a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) approach, which stabilizes the training process by progressively introducing more challenging queries through a two-stage strategy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ACQO achieves state-of-the-art performance on three complex query benchmarks, significantly outperforming established baselines. The framework also showcases improved computational efficiency and broad compatibility with different retrieval architectures, establishing it as a powerful and generalizable solution for next-generation RAG systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to tasks that involve causal reasoning. However, current benchmarks often rely on string matching or surface-level metrics that do not capture whether the output of a model is formally valid under the semantics of causal reasoning. To address this, we propose DoVerifier, a simple symbolic verifier that checks whether LLM-generated causal expressions are derivable from a given causal graph using rules from do-calculus and probability theory. This allows us to recover correct answers to causal queries that would otherwise be marked incorrect due to superficial differences in their causal semantics. Our evaluations on synthetic data and causal QA benchmarks show that DoVerifier more accurately captures semantic correctness of causal reasoning traces, offering a more rigorous and informative way to evaluate LLMs on causal reasoning.

Abstract: Effective urban planning is crucial for enhancing residents' quality of life and ensuring societal stability, playing a pivotal role in the sustainable development of cities. Current planning methods heavily rely on human experts, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, or utilize deep learning algorithms, often limiting stakeholder involvement. To bridge these gaps, we propose Intelli-Planner, a novel framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate participatory and customized planning scheme generation. Intelli-Planner utilizes demographic, geographic data, and planning preferences to determine high-level planning requirements and demands for each functional type. During training, a knowledge enhancement module is employed to enhance the decision-making capability of the policy network. Additionally, we establish a multi-dimensional evaluation system and employ LLM-based stakeholders for satisfaction scoring. Experimental validation across diverse urban settings shows that Intelli-Planner surpasses traditional baselines and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL-based methods in objective metrics, while enhancing stakeholder satisfaction and convergence speed. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our framework, highlighting the potential for integrating the latest advancements in LLMs with DRL approaches to revolutionize tasks related to functional areas planning.

Abstract: Most governance frameworks assume that rules can be defined in advance, systems can be engineered to comply, and accountability can be applied after outcomes occur. This model worked when machines replaced physical labor or accelerated calculation. It no longer holds when judgment itself is delegated to agentic AI systems operating at machine speed. The central issue here is not safety, efficiency, or employment. It is whether humans remain relevant participants in systems that increasingly shape social, economic, and political outcomes. This paper argues that static, compliance-based governance fails once decision-making moves to runtime and becomes opaque. It further argues that the core challenge is not whether AI is conscious, but whether humans can maintain meaningful communication, influence, and co-evolution with increasingly alien forms of intelligence. We position runtime governance, specifically, a newly proposed concept called the Governance Twin [1]; as a strong candidate for preserving human relevance, while acknowledging that accountability, agency, and even punishment must be rethought in this transition.

Abstract: Autonomous code agents built on large language models are reshaping software and AI development through tool use, long-horizon reasoning, and self-directed interaction. However, this autonomy introduces a previously unrecognized security risk: agentic interaction fundamentally expands the LLM attack surface, enabling systematic probing and recovery of hidden system prompts that guide model behavior. We identify system prompt extraction as an emergent vulnerability intrinsic to code agents and present \textbf{\textsc{JustAsk}}, a self-evolving framework that autonomously discovers effective extraction strategies through interaction alone. Unlike prior prompt-engineering or dataset-based attacks, \textsc{JustAsk} requires no handcrafted prompts, labeled supervision, or privileged access beyond standard user interaction. It formulates extraction as an online exploration problem, using Upper Confidence Bound--based strategy selection and a hierarchical skill space spanning atomic probes and high-level orchestration. These skills exploit imperfect system-instruction generalization and inherent tensions between helpfulness and safety. Evaluated on \textbf{41} black-box commercial models across multiple providers, \textsc{JustAsk} consistently achieves full or near-complete system prompt recovery, revealing recurring design- and architecture-level vulnerabilities. Our results expose system prompts as a critical yet largely unprotected attack surface in modern agent systems.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have advanced Automated Heuristic Design, treating algorithm evolution as a monolithic text generation task overlooks the coupling between discrete algorithmic structures and continuous numerical parameters. Consequently, existing methods often discard promising algorithms due to uncalibrated constants and suffer from premature convergence resulting from simple similarity metrics. To address these limitations, we propose TIDE, a Tuning-Integrated Dynamic Evolution framework designed to decouple structural reasoning from parameter optimization. TIDE features a nested architecture where an outer parallel island model utilizes Tree Similarity Edit Distance to drive structural diversity, while an inner loop integrates LLM-based logic generation with a differential mutation operator for parameter tuning. Additionally, a UCB-based scheduler dynamically prioritizes high-yield prompt strategies to optimize resource allocation. Extensive experiments across nine combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate that TIDE discovers heuristics that significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines in solution quality while achieving improved search efficiency and reduced computational costs.

Abstract: The machine learning community has achieved remarkable success with universal foundation models for time-series and physical dynamics, largely overcoming earlier approximation barriers in smooth or slowly varying regimes through scale and specialized architectures. However, deploying these monolithic models in safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), governed by non-stationary lifecycle dynamics and strict reliability requirements, reveals persistent challenges. Recent evidence shows that fine-tuning time-series foundation models induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on prior regimes. Standard models continue to exhibit residual spectral bias, smoothing high-frequency discontinuities characteristic of incipient faults, while their opacity hinders formal verification and traceability demanded by safety standards (e.g., ISO 26262, IEC 61508). This position paper argues that the plasticity-stability paradox cannot be fully resolved by global parameter updates (whether via offline fine-tuning or online adaptation). Instead, we advocate a Modular Sovereignty paradigm: a library of compact, frozen regime-specific specialists combined via uncertainty-aware blending, which we term "HYDRA" (Hierarchical uncertaintY-aware Dynamics for Rapidly-Adapting systems). This paradigm ensures regime-conditional validity, rigorous disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and modular auditability, offering a certifiable path for robust state integrity across the CPS lifecycle.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an important and safety-critical task, and recent advances in LLMs/VLMs have opened new possibilities for reasoning and planning in this domain. However, large models demand substantial GPU memory and exhibit high inference latency, while conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggles to bridge the capability gaps of small models. To address these limitations, we propose Drive-KD, a framework that decomposes autonomous driving into a "perception-reasoning-planning" triad and transfers these capabilities via knowledge distillation. We identify layer-specific attention as the distillation signal to construct capability-specific single-teacher models that outperform baselines. Moreover, we unify these single-teacher settings into a multi-teacher distillation framework and introduce asymmetric gradient projection to mitigate cross-capability gradient conflicts. Extensive evaluations validate the generalization of our method across diverse model families and scales. Experiments show that our distilled InternVL3-1B model, with ~42 times less GPU memory and ~11.4 times higher throughput, achieves better overall performance than the pretrained 78B model from the same family on DriveBench, and surpasses GPT-5.1 on the planning dimension, providing insights toward efficient autonomous driving VLMs.

Abstract: This brief proposes \emph{White-Op}, an interpretable operational amplifier (op-amp) parameter design framework based on the human-mimicking reasoning of large-language-model agents. We formalize the implicit human reasoning mechanism into explicit steps of \emph{\textbf{introducing hypothetical constraints}}, and develop an iterative, human-like \emph{\textbf{hypothesis-verification-decision}} workflow. Specifically, the agent is guided to introduce hypothetical constraints to derive and properly regulate positions of symbolically tractable poles and zeros, thus formulating a closed-form mathematical optimization problem, which is then solved programmatically and verified via simulation. Theory-simulation result analysis guides the decision-making for refinement. Experiments on 9 op-amp topologies show that, unlike the uninterpretable black-box baseline which finally fails in 5 topologies, White-Op achieves reliable, interpretable behavioral-level designs with only 8.52\% theoretical prediction error and the design functionality retains after transistor-level mapping for all topologies. White-Op is open-sourced at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/zhchenfdu/whiteop}.

Abstract: Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.

We answer this by evaluating 12 LLMs on 10 creativity prompts with 100 samples each (N = 12,000). For output quality (originality), prompts explain 36.43% of variance, comparable to model choice (40.94%). But for output quantity (fluency), model choice (51.25%) and within-LLM variance (33.70%) dominate, with prompts explaining only 4.22%. Prompts are powerful levers for steering output quality, but given the substantial within-LLM variance (10-34%), single-sample evaluations risk conflating sampling noise with genuine prompt or model effects.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide rich longitudinal clinical evidence that is central to medical decision-making, motivating the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language model (LLM) predictions. However, long-horizon EHRs often exceed LLM context limits, and existing approaches commonly rely on truncation or vanilla retrieval strategies that discard clinically relevant events and temporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose EHR-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework designed for accurate interpretation of long-horizon structured EHR data. EHR-RAG introduces three components tailored to longitudinal clinical prediction tasks: Event- and Time-Aware Hybrid EHR Retrieval to preserve clinical structure and temporal dynamics, Adaptive Iterative Retrieval to progressively refine queries in order to expand broad evidence coverage, and Dual-Path Evidence Retrieval and Reasoning to jointly retrieves and reasons over both factual and counterfactual evidence. Experiments across four long-horizon EHR prediction tasks show that EHR-RAG consistently outperforms the strongest LLM-based baselines, achieving an average Macro-F1 improvement of 10.76%. Overall, our work highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented LLMs to advance clinical prediction on structured EHR data in practice.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved substantial progress in general-purpose perception and reasoning. Nevertheless, their deployment in Food-Service and Retail Stores (FSRS) scenarios encounters two major obstacles: (i) real-world FSRS data, collected from heterogeneous acquisition devices, are highly noisy and lack auditable, closed-loop data curation, which impedes the construction of high-quality, controllable, and reproducible training corpora; and (ii) existing evaluation protocols do not offer a unified, fine-grained and standardized benchmark spanning single-image, multi-image, and video inputs, making it challenging to objectively gauge model robustness. To address these challenges, we first develop Ostrakon-VL, an FSRS-oriented MLLM based on Qwen3-VL-8B. Second, we introduce ShopBench, the first public benchmark for FSRS. Third, we propose QUAD (Quality-aware Unbiased Automated Data-curation), a multi-stage multimodal instruction data curation pipeline. Leveraging a multi-stage training strategy, Ostrakon-VL achieves an average score of 60.1 on ShopBench, establishing a new state of the art among open-source MLLMs with comparable parameter scales and diverse architectures. Notably, it surpasses the substantially larger Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (59.4) by +0.7, and exceeds the same-scale Qwen3-VL-8B (55.3) by +4.8, demonstrating significantly improved parameter efficiency. These results indicate that Ostrakon-VL delivers more robust and reliable FSRS-centric perception and decision-making capabilities. To facilitate reproducible research, we will publicly release Ostrakon-VL and the ShopBench benchmark.

Abstract: GUI agents are designed to automate repetitive tasks and enhance productivity. However, existing GUI agents struggle to recover once they follow an incorrect exploration path, often leading to task failure. In this work, we model GUI task execution as a DFS process and propose BEAP-Agent, a DFS-based framework that supports long-range, multi-level state backtracking with dynamic task tracking and updating. The framework consists of three collaborative components: Planner, Executor, and Tracker. Together, they enable effective task exploration and execution. BEAP-Agent fills the gap in systematic backtracking mechanisms for GUI agents, offering a systematic solution for long-horizon task exploration. We conducted a systematic evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark, where BEAP-Agent achieved an accuracy of 28.2%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex problems, but remains constrained by the computational cost and reasoning path collapse when grounded in discrete token spaces. Recent latent reasoning approaches attempt to optimize efficiency by performing reasoning within continuous hidden states. However, these methods typically operate as opaque end-to-end mappings from explicit reasoning steps to latent states, and often require a pre-defined number of latent steps during inference. In this work, we introduce PLaT (Planning with Latent Thoughts), a framework that reformulates latent reasoning as planning by fundamentally decouple reasoning from verbalization. We model reasoning as a deterministic trajectory of latent planning states, while a separate Decoder grounds these thoughts into text when necessary. This decoupling allows the model to dynamically determine when to terminate reasoning rather than relying on fixed hyperparameters. Empirical results on mathematical benchmarks reveal a distinct trade-off: while PLaT achieves lower greedy accuracy than baselines, it demonstrates superior scalability in terms of reasoning diversity. This indicates that PLaT learns a robust, broader solution space, offering a transparent and scalable foundation for inference-time search.

Abstract: Backpropagation algorithm has driven the remarkable success of deep neural networks, but its lack of biological plausibility and high computational costs have motivated the ongoing search for alternative training methods. Hebbian learning has attracted considerable interest as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation. Nevertheless, its exclusive reliance on local information, without consideration of global task objectives, fundamentally limits its scalability. Inspired by the biological synergy between neuromodulators and local plasticity, we introduce a novel model-agnostic Global-guided Hebbian Learning (GHL) framework, which seamlessly integrates local and global information to scale up across diverse networks and tasks. In specific, the local component employs Oja's rule with competitive learning to ensure stable and effective local updates. Meanwhile, the global component introduces a sign-based signal that guides the direction of local Hebbian plasticity updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing Hebbian approaches. Notably, on large-scale network and complex datasets like ImageNet, our framework achieves the competitive results and significantly narrows the gap with standard backpropagation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency. We evaluate NEMO on nine established optimization benchmarks. As depicted in Figure 1, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the majority of tasks, with substantial margins on several datasets, demonstrating the power of execution-aware agentic architectures for automated optimization modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise as teaching assistants, yet their teaching capability remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on problem-solving or problem-level guidance, leaving knowledge-centered teaching underexplored. We propose a syllabus-grounded evaluation framework that measures LLM teaching capability via student performance improvement after multi-turn instruction. By restricting teacher agents to structured knowledge points and example problems, the framework avoids information leakage and enables reuse of existing benchmarks. We instantiate the framework on Gaokao data across multiple subjects. Experiments reveal substantial variation in teaching effectiveness across models and domains: some models perform well in mathematics, while teaching remains challenging in physics and chemistry. We also find that incorporating example problems does not necessarily improve teaching, as models often shift toward example-specific error correction. Overall, our results highlight teaching ability as a distinct and measurable dimension of LLM behavior.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In real-world data science and enterprise decision-making, critical information is often fragmented across directly queryable structured sources (e.g., SQL, CSV) and "zombie data" locked in unstructured visual documents (e.g., scanned reports, invoice images). Existing data analytics agents are predominantly limited to processing structured data, failing to activate and correlate this high-value visual information, thus creating a significant gap with industrial needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce DataCross, a novel benchmark and collaborative agent framework for unified, insight-driven analysis across heterogeneous data modalities. DataCrossBench comprises 200 end-to-end analysis tasks across finance, healthcare, and other domains. It is constructed via a human-in-the-loop reverse-synthesis pipeline, ensuring realistic complexity, cross-source dependency, and verifiable ground truth. The benchmark categorizes tasks into three difficulty tiers to evaluate agents' capabilities in visual table extraction, cross-modal alignment, and multi-step joint reasoning. We also propose the DataCrossAgent framework, inspired by the "divide-and-conquer" workflow of human analysts. It employs specialized sub-agents, each an expert on a specific data source, which are coordinated via a structured workflow of Intra-source Deep Exploration, Key Source Identification, and Contextual Cross-pollination. A novel reReAct mechanism enables robust code generation and debugging for factual verification. Experimental results show that DataCrossAgent achieves a 29.7% improvement in factuality over GPT-4o and exhibits superior robustness on high-difficulty tasks, effectively activating fragmented "zombie data" for insightful, cross-modal analysis.

Abstract: Training a unified language model that adapts between intuitive System 1 and deliberative System 2 remains challenging due to interference between their cognitive modes. Recent studies have thus pursued making System 2 models more efficient. However, these approaches focused on output control, limiting what models produce. We argue that this paradigm is misaligned: output length is merely a symptom of the model's cognitive configuration, not the root cause. In this work, we shift the focus to capability control, which modulates \textit{how models think} rather than \textit{what they produce}. To realize this, we leverage existing Instruct and Thinking checkpoints through dynamic parameter interpolation, without additional training. Our pilot study establishes that linear interpolation yields a convex, monotonic Pareto frontier, underpinned by representation continuity and structural connectivity. Building on this, we propose \textbf{DAMI} (\textbf{D}yn\textbf{A}mic \textbf{M}odel \textbf{I}nterpolation), a framework that estimates a query-specific Reasoning Intensity $λ(q)$ to configure cognitive depth. For training-based estimation, we develop a preference learning method encoding accuracy and efficiency criteria. For zero-shot deployment, we introduce a confidence-based method leveraging inter-model cognitive discrepancy. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that DAMI achieves higher accuracy than the Thinking model while remaining efficient, effectively combining the efficiency of System 1 with the reasoning depth of System 2.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When a user tells an AI system that someone "should not" take an action, the system ought to treat this as a prohibition. Yet many large language models do the opposite: they interpret negated instructions as affirmations. We audited 16 models across 14 ethical scenarios and found that open-source models endorse prohibited actions 77% of the time under simple negation and 100% under compound negation -- a 317% increase over affirmative framing. Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones. These patterns hold under deterministic decoding, ruling out sampling noise. We present case studies showing how these failures play out in practice, propose the Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) as a governance metric, and outline a tiered certification framework with domain-specific thresholds. The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish "do X" from "do not X" should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely documented to be sensitive to minor prompt perturbations and prone to sycophantic alignment with user biases, their robustness in consequential, rule-bound decision-making remains under-explored. In this work, we uncover a striking "Paradox of Robustness": despite their known lexical brittleness, instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit a behavioral and near-total invariance to emotional framing effects. Using a novel controlled perturbation framework across three high-stakes domains (healthcare, law, and finance), we quantify a robustness gap where LLMs demonstrate 110-300 times greater resistance to narrative manipulation than human subjects. Specifically, we find a near-zero effect size for models (Cohen's h = 0.003) compared to the substantial biases observed in humans (Cohen's h in [0.3, 0.8]). This result is highly counterintuitive and suggests the mechanisms driving sycophancy and prompt sensitivity do not necessarily translate to a failure in logical constraint satisfaction. We show that this invariance persists across models with diverse training paradigms. Our findings show that while LLMs may be "brittle" to how a query is formatted, they are remarkably "stable" against why a decision should be biased. Our findings establish that instruction-tuned models can decouple logical rule-adherence from persuasive narratives, offering a source of decision stability that complements, and even potentially de-biases, human judgment in institutional contexts. We release the 162-scenario benchmark, code, and data to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of narrative-induced bias and robustness on GitHub.com.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in hardware engineering, current benchmarks suffer from saturation and limited task diversity, failing to reflect LLMs' performance in real industrial workflows. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark for AI-aided chip design that rigorously evaluates LLMs across three critical tasks: Verilog generation, debugging, and reference model generation. Our benchmark features 44 realistic modules with complex hierarchical structures, 89 systematic debugging cases, and 132 reference model samples across Python, SystemC, and CXXRTL. Evaluation results reveal substantial performance gaps, with state-of-the-art Claude-4.5-opus achieving only 30.74\% on Verilog generation and 13.33\% on Python reference model generation, demonstrating significant challenges compared to existing saturated benchmarks where SOTA models achieve over 95\% pass rates. Additionally, to help enhance LLM reference model generation, we provide an automated toolbox for high-quality training data generation, facilitating future research in this underexplored domain. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhongkaiyu/ChipBench.git.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid advancement of multimodal domains has driven a data-centric paradigm shift in graph ML, transitioning from text-attributed to multimodal-attributed graphs. This advancement significantly enhances data representation and expands the scope of graph downstream tasks, such as modality-oriented tasks, thereby improving the practical utility of graph ML. Despite its promise, limitations exist in the current neural paradigms: (1) Neglect Context in Modality Alignment: Most existing methods adopt topology-constrained or modality-specific operators as tokenizers. These aligners inevitably neglect graph context and inhibit modality interaction, resulting in suboptimal alignment. (2) Lack of Adaptation in Modality Fusion: Most existing methods are simple adaptations for 2-modality graphs and fail to adequately exploit aligned tokens equipped with topology priors during fusion, leading to poor generalizability and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose LION (c\underline{LI}ff\underline{O}rd \underline{N}eural paradigm) based on the Clifford algebra and decoupled graph neural paradigm (i.e., propagation-then-aggregation) to implement alignment-then-fusion in multimodal-attributed graphs. Specifically, we first construct a modality-aware geometric manifold grounded in Clifford algebra. This geometric-induced high-order graph propagation efficiently achieves modality interaction, facilitating modality alignment. Then, based on the geometric grade properties of aligned tokens, we propose adaptive holographic aggregation. This module integrates the energy and scale of geometric grades with learnable parameters to improve modality fusion. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets demonstrate that LION significantly outperforms SOTA baselines across 3 graph and 3 modality downstream tasks.

Abstract: Text clustering is today the most popular paradigm for topic modelling, both in academia and industry. Despite clustering topic models' apparent success, we identify a number of issues in Top2Vec and BERTopic, which remain largely unsolved. Firstly, these approaches are unreliable at discovering natural clusters in corpora, due to extreme sensitivity to sample size and hyperparameters, the default values of which result in suboptimal behaviour. Secondly, when estimating term importance, BERTopic ignores the semantic distance of keywords to topic vectors, while Top2Vec ignores word counts in the corpus. This results in, on the one hand, less coherent topics due to the presence of stop words and junk words, and lack of variety and trust on the other. In this paper, I introduce a new approach, \textbf{Topeax}, which discovers the number of clusters from peaks in density estimates, and combines lexical and semantic indices of term importance to gain high-quality topic keywords. Topeax is demonstrated to be better at both cluster recovery and cluster description than Top2Vec and BERTopic, while also exhibiting less erratic behaviour in response to changing sample size and hyperparameters.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic reasoning necessitates effectively compressing growing interaction histories into a limited context window. Most existing memory systems serialize history as text, where token-level cost is uniform and scales linearly with length, often spending scarce budget on low-value details. To this end, we introduce MemOCR, a multimodal memory agent that improves long-horizon reasoning under tight context budgets by allocating memory space with adaptive information density through visual layout. Concretely, MemOCR maintains a structured rich-text memory (e.g., headings, highlights) and renders it into an image that the agent consults for memory access, visually prioritizing crucial evidence while aggressively compressing auxiliary details. To ensure robustness across varying memory budgets, we train MemOCR with reinforcement learning under budget-aware objectives that expose the agent to diverse compression levels. Across long-context multi-hop and single-hop question-answering benchmarks, MemOCR outperforms strong text-based baselines and achieves more effective context utilization under extreme budgets.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent simulations are increasingly adopted across application domains, but remain difficult to scale due to GPU memory pressure. Each agent maintains private GPU-resident states, including models, prefix caches, and adapters, which quickly exhaust device memory as the agent count grows. We identify two key properties of these workloads: sparse agent activation and an estimable agent invocation order. Based on an analysis of representative workload classes, we introduce invocation distance, a unified abstraction that estimates the relative order in which agents will issue future LLM requests. Leveraging this abstraction, we present ScaleSim, a memory-efficient LLM serving system for large-scale multi-agent simulations. ScaleSim enables proactive prefetching and priority-based eviction, supports diverse agent-specific memory through a modular interface, and achieves up to 1.74x speedup over SGLang on simulation benchmarks.

Abstract: Controlling the behavior of large language models (LLMs) at inference time is essential for aligning outputs with human abilities and safety requirements. \emph{Activation steering} provides a lightweight alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning by directly modifying internal activations to guide generation. This research advances the literature in three significant directions. First, while previous work demonstrated the technical feasibility of steering emotional tone using automated classifiers, this paper presents the first human evaluation of activation steering concerning the emotional tone of LLM outputs, collecting over 7,000 crowd-sourced ratings from 190 participants via Prolific ($n=190$). These ratings assess both perceived emotional intensity and overall text quality. Second, we find strong alignment between human and model-based quality ratings (mean $r=0.776$, range $0.157$--$0.985$), indicating automatic scoring can proxy perceived quality. Moderate steering strengths ($λ\approx 0.15$) reliably amplify target emotions while preserving comprehensibility, with the strongest effects for disgust ($η_p^2 = 0.616$) and fear ($η_p^2 = 0.540$), and minimal effects for surprise ($η_p^2 = 0.042$). Finally, upgrading from Alpaca to LlaMA-3 yielded more consistent steering with significant effects across emotions and strengths (all $p < 0.001$). Inter-rater reliability was high (ICC $= 0.71$--$0.87$), underscoring the robustness of the findings. These findings support activation-based control as a scalable method for steering LLM behavior across affective dimensions.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled automated algorithm design (AAD) by generating optimization algorithms directly from natural-language prompts. While evolutionary frameworks such as LLaMEA demonstrate strong exploratory capabilities across the algorithm design space, their search dynamics are entirely driven by fitness feedback, leaving substantial information about the generated code unused. We propose a mechanism for guiding AAD using feedback constructed from graph-theoretic and complexity features extracted from the abstract syntax trees of the generated algorithms, based on a surrogate model learned over an archive of evaluated solutions. Using explainable AI techniques, we identify features that substantially affect performance and translate them into natural-language mutation instructions that steer subsequent LLM-based code generation without restricting expressivity.
  We propose LLaMEA-SAGE, which integrates this feature-driven guidance into LLaMEA, and evaluate it across several benchmarks. We show that the proposed structured guidance achieves the same performance faster than vanilla LLaMEA in a small controlled experiment. In a larger-scale experiment using the MA-BBOB suite from the GECCO-MA-BBOB competition, our guided approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art AAD methods. These results demonstrate that signals derived from code can effectively bias LLM-driven algorithm evolution, bridging the gap between code structure and human-understandable performance feedback in automated algorithm design.

Abstract: We introduce KAPSO, a modular framework for autonomous program synthesis and optimization. Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes.
  KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence.
  We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

Abstract: Existing multi-expert LLM systems gather diverse perspectives but combine them through simple aggregation, obscuring which arguments drove the final decision. We introduce ARGORA, a framework that organizes multi-expert discussions into explicit argumentation graphs showing which arguments support or attack each other. By casting these graphs as causal models, ARGORA can systematically remove individual arguments and recompute outcomes, identifying which reasoning chains were necessary and whether decisions would change under targeted modifications. We further introduce a correction mechanism that aligns internal reasoning with external judgments when they disagree. Across diverse benchmarks and an open-ended use case, ARGORA achieves competitive accuracy and demonstrates corrective behavior: when experts initially disagree, the framework resolves disputes toward correct answers more often than it introduces new errors, while providing causal diagnostics of decisive arguments.

Abstract: Agentic large language model (LLM) systems rely on external memory for long-horizon state and concurrent multi-agent execution, but centralized indexes and heuristic partitions become bottlenecks as memory volume and parallel access grow. We present ShardMemo, a budgeted tiered memory service with Tier A per-agent working state, Tier B sharded evidence with shard-local approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes, and Tier C, a versioned skill library. Tier B enforces scope-before-routing: structured eligibility constraints mask ineligible shards before routing or ANN search. We cast shard probing as masked mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing over eligible shards, probing up to $B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ shards via Top-$B_{\mathrm{probe}}$ or adaptive Top-$P$, and use cost-aware gating over profile/observation/session shard families; the router is trained from evidence-to-shard supervision. On LoCoMo, ShardMemo improves over the strongest baseline (GAM) by +5.11 to +6.82 F1 across question categories. Under a fixed-budget routing setting ($B_{\mathrm{probe}}=3$), ShardMemo improves over cosine-to-prototype shard routing by +6.87 F1 while reducing retrieval work (VecScan 521->414, -20.5%) and p95 latency (95->76 ms). On long-context HotpotQA, ShardMemo achieves 63.41/61.88/57.95 F1 at 56K/224K/448K tokens. On ToolBench, Tier C reaches 0.97 Precision@3 and 1.94 StepRed (+10.2% and +7.2% over embedding-similarity retrieval).

Abstract: The operational efficacy of large language models relies heavily on their inference-time context. This has established Context Engineering (CE) as a formal discipline for optimizing these inputs. Current CE methods rely on manually crafted harnesses, such as rigid generation-reflection workflows and predefined context schemas. They impose structural biases and restrict context optimization to a narrow, intuition-bound design space. To address this, we introduce Meta Context Engineering (MCE), a bi-level framework that supersedes static CE heuristics by co-evolving CE skills and context artifacts. In MCE iterations, a meta-level agent refines engineering skills via agentic crossover, a deliberative search over the history of skills, their executions, and evaluations. A base-level agent executes these skills, learns from training rollouts, and optimizes context as flexible files and code. We evaluate MCE across five disparate domains under offline and online settings. MCE demonstrates consistent performance gains, achieving 5.6--53.8% relative improvement over state-of-the-art agentic CE methods (mean of 16.9%), while maintaining superior context adaptability, transferability, and efficiency in both context usage and training.

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has unlocked advanced reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with intermediate steps, yet incurs prohibitive computational costs due to generation of extra tokens. Recent studies empirically show that compressing reasoning steps into latent states, or implicit CoT compression, offers a token-efficient alternative. However, the mechanism behind CoT compression remains unclear. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the difficulty of learning to internalize intermediate reasoning steps. By introducing Order-r Interaction, we prove that the learning signal for high-order logical dependencies exponentially decays to solve irreducible problem, where skipping intermediate steps inevitably leads to high-order interaction barriers. To empirically validate this, we introduce NatBool-DAG, a challenging benchmark designed to enforce irreducible logical reasoning and eliminate semantic shortcuts. Guided by our theoretical findings, we propose ALiCoT (Aligned Implicit CoT), a novel framework that overcomes the signal decay by aligning latent token distributions with intermediate reasoning states. Experimental results demonstrate that ALiCoT successfully unlocks efficient reasoning: it achieves a 54.4x speedup while maintaining performance comparable to explicit CoT.

Abstract: Depth-recurrence facilitates latent reasoning by sharing parameters across depths. However, prior work lacks combined FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched baselines, underutilizes depth-recurrence due to partially fixed layer stacks, and ignores the bottleneck of constant hidden-sizes that restricts many-step latent reasoning. To address this, we introduce a modular framework of depth-recurrent attention mixtures (Dreamer), combining sequence attention, depth attention, and sparse expert attention. It alleviates the hidden-size bottleneck through attention along depth, decouples scaling dimensions, and allows depth-recurrent models to scale efficiently and effectively. Across language reasoning benchmarks, our models require 2 to 8x fewer training tokens for the same accuracy as FLOP-, parameter-, and memory-matched SOTA, and outperform ca. 2x larger SOTA models with the same training tokens. We further present insights into knowledge usage across depths, e.g., showing 2 to 11x larger expert selection diversity than SOTA MoEs.

Abstract: Aiming at efficient and dense chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, latent reasoning methods fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to substitute discrete language tokens with continuous latent tokens. These methods consume fewer tokens compared to the conventional language CoT reasoning and have the potential to plan in a dense latent space. However, current latent tokens are generally supervised based on imitating language labels. Considering that there can be multiple equivalent but diverse CoT labels for a question, passively imitating an arbitrary one may lead to inferior latent token representations and latent reasoning policies, undermining the potential planning ability and resulting in clear gaps between training and testing. In this work, we emphasize the importance of active planning over the representation space of latent tokens in achieving the optimal latent reasoning policy. So, we propose the \underline{A}c\underline{t}ive Latent \underline{P}lanning method (ATP-Latent), which models the supervision process of latent tokens as a conditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) to obtain a smoother latent space. Moreover, to facilitate the most reasonable latent reasoning policy, ATP-Latent conducts reinforcement learning (RL) with an auxiliary coherence reward, which is calculated based on the consistency between VAE-decoded contents of latent tokens, enabling a guided RL process. In experiments on LLaMA-1B, ATP-Latent demonstrates +4.1\% accuracy and -3.3\% tokens on four benchmarks compared to advanced baselines. Codes are available on https://github.com/zz1358m/ATP-Latent-master.

Abstract: Enterprise-grade Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) systems support high-stakes workflows across finance, insurance, and healthcare. Early-phase system validation under limited budgets mandates uncovering diverse failure mechanisms, rather than identifying a single worst-case document. We formalize this challenge as a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) problem, aiming to identify complex interactions between document variables, with the objective to maximize the number of distinct failure types discovered within a fixed evaluation budget. Our methodology operates on a combinatorial space of document configurations, rendering instances of structural \emph{risk features} to induce realistic failure conditions. We benchmark a diverse portfolio of search strategies spanning evolutionary, swarm-based, quality-diversity, learning-based, and quantum under identical budget constraints. Through configuration-level exclusivity, win-rate, and cross-temporal overlap analyses, we show that different solvers consistently uncover failure modes that remain undiscovered by specific alternatives at comparable budgets. Crucially, cross-temporal analysis reveals persistent solver-specific discoveries across all evaluated budgets, with no single strategy exhibiting absolute dominance. While the union of all solvers eventually recovers the observed failure space, reliance on any individual method systematically delays the discovery of important risks. These results demonstrate intrinsic solver complementarity and motivate portfolio-based SBST strategies for robust industrial IDP validation.

Abstract: Agentic recommender systems leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to model complex user behaviors and support personalized decision-making. However, existing methods primarily model preference changes based on explicit user-item interactions, which are sparse, noisy, and unable to reflect the real-time, mutual influences among users and items. To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.

Abstract: Counting should not depend on what is being counted; more generally, any algorithm's behavior should be invariant to the semantic content of its arguments. We introduce WhatCounts to test this property in isolation. Unlike prior work that conflates semantic sensitivity with reasoning complexity or prompt variation, WhatCounts is atomic: count items in an unambiguous, delimited list with no duplicates, distractors, or reasoning steps for different semantic types. Frontier LLMs show over 40% accuracy variation depending solely on what is being counted - cities versus chemicals, names versus symbols. Controlled ablations rule out confounds. The gap is semantic, and it shifts unpredictably with small amounts of unrelated fine-tuning. LLMs do not implement algorithms; they approximate them, and the approximation is argument-dependent. As we show with an agentic example, this has implications beyond counting: any LLM function may carry hidden dependencies on the meaning of its inputs.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models have advanced from single-turn question answering to deep research workflows that iteratively plan queries, invoke external tools, and synthesize information to address complex information needs. Evaluating such workflows presents a fundamental challenge: reliance on live APIs introduces non-determinism, as tool invocations may yield different results across runs due to temporal drift, rate limiting, and evolving backend states. This variance undermines reproducibility and invalidates cross-system comparisons.
  We present ScholarGym, a simulation environment for reproducible evaluation of deep research workflows on academic literature. The environment decouples workflow components into query planning, tool invocation, and relevance assessment, enabling fine-grained analysis of each stage under controlled conditions. Built on a static corpus of 570K papers with deterministic retrieval, ScholarGym provides 2,536 queries with expert-annotated ground truth. Experiments across diverse backbone models reveal how reasoning capabilities, planning strategies, and selection mechanisms interact over iterative refinement.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are a major focus of recent AI research. However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding. We release SONIC-O1 for reproducibility and research: Project page: https://vectorinstitute.github.io/sonic-o1/ Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/vector-institute/sonic-o1 Github: https://github.com/vectorinstitute/sonic-o1 Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/vector-institute/sonic-o1-leaderboard

Abstract: Fine-Tuning-as-a-Service (FTaaS) facilitates the customization of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) but introduces critical backdoor risks via poisoned data. Existing defenses either rely on supervised signals or fail to generalize across diverse trigger types and modalities. In this work, we uncover a universal backdoor fingerprint-attention allocation divergence-where poisoned samples disrupt the balanced attention distribution across three functional components: system instructions, vision inputs, and user textual queries, regardless of trigger morphology. Motivated by this insight, we propose Tri-Component Attention Profiling (TCAP), an unsupervised defense framework to filter backdoor samples. TCAP decomposes cross-modal attention maps into the three components, identifies trigger-responsive attention heads via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) statistical profiling, and isolates poisoned samples through EM-based vote aggregation. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and attack methods demonstrate that TCAP achieves consistently strong performance, establishing it as a robust and practical backdoor defense in MLLMs.

We propose the \textbf{Fovea-Block-Skip Transformer} (FBS), which injects a causal, trainable loop into Transformers via Parafovea-Attention Window (PAW), Chunk-Head (CH), and Skip-Gate (SG). Across diverse benchmarks, FBS improves the quality-efficiency trade-off without increasing parameters, and ablations show the three modules are complementary.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) agents towards System~2 reasoning, characterized by deliberative, high-precision problem-solving, requires maintaining rigorous logical integrity over extended horizons. However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\%.

Abstract: Deep time series models are vulnerable to noisy data ubiquitous in real-world applications. Existing robustness strategies either prune data or rely on costly prior quantification, failing to balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DropoutTS, a model-agnostic plugin that shifts the paradigm from "what" to learn to "how much" to learn. DropoutTS employs a Sample-Adaptive Dropout mechanism: leveraging spectral sparsity to efficiently quantify instance-level noise via reconstruction residuals, it dynamically calibrates model learning capacity by mapping noise to adaptive dropout rates - selectively suppressing spurious fluctuations while preserving fine-grained fidelity. Extensive experiments across diverse noise regimes and open benchmarks show DropoutTS consistently boosts superior backbones' performance, delivering advanced robustness with negligible parameter overhead and no architectural modifications. Our code is available at https://github.com/CityMind-Lab/DropoutTS.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Individual agents in multi-agent (MA) systems often lack robustness, tending to blindly conform to misleading peers. We show this weakness stems from both sycophancy and inadequate ability to evaluate peer reliability. To address this, we first formalize the learning problem of history-aware reference, introducing the historical interactions of peers as additional input, so that agents can estimate peer reliability and learn from trustworthy peers when uncertain. This shifts the task from evaluating peer reasoning quality to estimating peer reliability based on interaction history. We then develop Epistemic Context Learning (ECL): a reasoning framework that conditions predictions on explicitly-built peer profiles from history. We further optimize ECL by reinforcement learning using auxiliary rewards. Our experiments reveal that our ECL enables small models like Qwen 3-4B to outperform a history-agnostic baseline 8x its size (Qwen 3-30B) by accurately identifying reliable peers. ECL also boosts frontier models to near-perfect (100%) performance. We show that ECL generalizes well to various MA configurations and we find that trust is modeled well by LLMs, revealing a strong correlation in trust modeling accuracy and final answer quality.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language-based agentic tasks, their applicability to unseen, nonlinguistic environments (e.g., symbolic or spatial tasks) remains limited. Previous work attributes this performance gap to the mismatch between the pretraining distribution and the testing distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the primary bottleneck is the prohibitive cost of exploration: mastering these tasks requires extensive trial-and-error, which is computationally unsustainable for parameter-heavy LLMs operating in a high dimensional semantic space. To address this, we propose SCOUT (Sub-Scale Collaboration On Unseen Tasks), a novel framework that decouples exploration from exploitation. We employ lightweight "scouts" (e.g., small MLPs) to probe environmental dynamics at a speed and scale far exceeding LLMs. The collected trajectories are utilized to bootstrap the LLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by multi-turn Reinforcement Learning (RL) to activate its latent world knowledge. Empirically, SCOUT enables a Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model to achieve an average score of 0.86, significantly outperforming proprietary models, including Gemini-2.5-Pro (0.60), while saving about 60% GPU hours consumption.

Abstract: Conventional supervised climate downscaling struggles to generalize to Global Climate Models (GCMs) due to the lack of paired training data and inherent domain gaps relative to reanalysis. Meanwhile, current zero-shot methods suffer from physical inconsistencies and vanishing gradient issues under large scaling factors. We propose Zero-Shot Statistical Downscaling (ZSSD), a zero-shot framework that performs statistical downscaling without paired data during training. ZSSD leverages a Physics-Consistent Climate Prior learned from reanalysis data, conditioned on geophysical boundaries and temporal information to enforce physical validity. Furthermore, to enable robust inference across varying GCMs, we introduce Unified Coordinate Guidance. This strategy addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla DPS and ensures consistency with large-scale fields. Results show that ZSSD significantly outperforms existing zero-shot baselines in 99th percentile errors and successfully reconstructs complex weather events, such as tropical cyclones, across heterogeneous GCMs.

Abstract: We present a conceptual space framework for modelling abstract concepts that unfold over time, demonstrated through a chess-based proof-of-concept. Strategy concepts, such as attack or sacrifice, are represented as geometric regions across interpretable quality dimensions, with chess games instantiated and analysed as trajectories whose directional movement toward regions enables recognition of intended strategies. This approach also supports dual-perspective modelling, capturing how players interpret identical situations differently. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory-based concept recognition, with movement patterns aligning with expert commentary. This work explores extending the conceptual spaces theory to temporally realised, goal-directed concepts. The approach establishes a foundation for broader applications involving sequential decision-making and supports integration with knowledge evolution mechanisms for learning and refining abstract concepts over time.

Abstract: This paper introduces BioAgent Bench, a benchmark dataset and an evaluation suite designed for measuring the performance and robustness of AI agents in common bioinformatics tasks. The benchmark contains curated end-to-end tasks (e.g., RNA-seq, variant calling, metagenomics) with prompts that specify concrete output artifacts to support automated assessment, including stress testing under controlled perturbations. We evaluate frontier closed-source and open-weight models across multiple agent harnesses, and use an LLM-based grader to score pipeline progress and outcome validity. We find that frontier agents can complete multi-step bioinformatics pipelines without elaborate custom scaffolding, often producing the requested final artifacts reliably. However, robustness tests reveal failure modes under controlled perturbations (corrupted inputs, decoy files, and prompt bloat), indicating that correct high-level pipeline construction does not guarantee reliable step-level reasoning. Finally, because bioinformatics workflows may involve sensitive patient data, proprietary references, or unpublished IP, closed-source models can be unsuitable under strict privacy constraints; in such settings, open-weight models may be preferable despite lower completion rates. We release the dataset and evaluation suite publicly.

Abstract: Endotracheal suctioning (ES) is an invasive yet essential clinical procedure that requires a high degree of skill to minimize patient risk - particularly in home care and educational settings, where consistent supervision may be limited. Despite its critical importance, automated recognition and feedback systems for ES training remain underexplored. To address this gap, this study proposes a unified, LLM-centered framework for video-based activity recognition benchmarked against conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, and a pilot study on feedback generation. Within this framework, the Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the central reasoning module, performing both spatiotemporal activity recognition and explainable decision analysis from video data. Furthermore, the LLM is capable of verbalizing feedback in natural language, thereby translating complex technical insights into accessible, human-understandable guidance for trainees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-based approach outperforms baseline models, achieving an improvement of approximately 15-20\% in both accuracy and F1 score. Beyond recognition, the framework incorporates a pilot student-support module built upon anomaly detection and explainable AI (XAI) principles, which provides automated, interpretable feedback highlighting correct actions and suggesting targeted improvements. Collectively, these contributions establish a scalable, interpretable, and data-driven foundation for advancing nursing education, enhancing training efficiency, and ultimately improving patient safety.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in sixth-generation (6G) networks and large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for ubiquitous intelligence, wherein seamless connectivity and distributed artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized various aspects of our lives.However, realizing this vision faces significant challenges owing to the fragmented and heterogeneous computing resources across hierarchical networks, which are insufficient for individual LLM agents to perform complex reasoning tasks.To address this issue, we propose Collaborative Orchestration Role at Edge (CORE), an innovative framework that employs a collaborative learning system in which multiple LLMs, each assigned a distinct functional role, are distributed across mobile devices and tiered edge servers. The system integrates three optimization modules, encompassing real-time perception,dynamic role orchestration, and pipeline-parallel execution, to facilitate efficient and rapid collaboration among distributed agents. Furthermore, we introduce a novel role affinity scheduling algorithm for dynamically orchestrating LLM role assignments across the hierarchical edge infrastructure, intelligently matching computational demands with available dispersed resources.Finally, comprehensive case studies and performance evaluations across various 6G application scenarios demonstrated the efficacy of CORE, revealing significant enhancements in the system efficiency and task completion rates. Building on these promising outcomes, we further validated the practical applicability of CORE by deploying it on a real-world edge-computing platform,that exhibits robust performance in operational environments.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a cost-effective, highly accessible and widely employed diagnostic tool. With the advent of Foundation Models (FMs), the field of AI-assisted ECG interpretation has begun to evolve, as they enable model reuse across different tasks by relying on embeddings. However, to responsibly employ FMs, it is crucial to rigorously assess to which extent the embeddings they produce are generalizable, particularly in error-sensitive domains such as healthcare. Although prior works have already addressed the problem of benchmarking ECG-expert FMs, they focus predominantly on the evaluation of downstream performance. To fill this gap, this study aims to find an in-depth, comprehensive benchmarking framework for FMs, with a specific focus on ECG-expert ones. To this aim, we introduce a benchmark methodology that complements performance-based evaluation with representation-level analysis, leveraging SHAP and UMAP techniques. Furthermore, we rely on the methodology for carrying out an extensive evaluation of several ECG-expert FMs pretrained via state-of-the-art techniques over different cross-continental datasets and data availability settings; this includes ones featuring data scarcity, a fairly common situation in real-world medical scenarios. Experimental results show that our benchmarking protocol provides a rich insight of ECG-expert FMs' embedded patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of their representational structure and generalizability.

Abstract: Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases that reinforce harmful stereotypes, limiting their safe deployment. Most existing debiasing methods adopt a suppressive paradigm by modifying parameters, prompts, or neurons associated with biased behavior; however, such approaches are often brittle, weakly generalizable, data-inefficient, and prone to degrading general capability. We propose \textbf{KnowBias}, a lightweight and conceptually distinct framework that mitigates bias by strengthening, rather than suppressing, neurons encoding bias-knowledge. KnowBias identifies neurons encoding bias knowledge using a small set of bias-knowledge questions via attribution-based analysis, and selectively enhances them at inference time. This design enables strong debiasing while preserving general capabilities, generalizes across bias types and demographics, and is highly data efficient, requiring only a handful of simple yes/no questions and no retraining. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art debiasing performance with minimal utility degradation.

Abstract: Web agents hold great potential for automating complex computer tasks, yet their interactions involve long-horizon, sequential decision-making with irreversible actions. In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.

Abstract: The rise of model hubs has made it easier to access reusable model components, making model merging a practical tool for combining capabilities. Yet, this modularity also creates a \emph{governance gap}: downstream users can recompose released weights into unauthorized mixtures that bypass safety alignment or licensing terms. Because existing defenses are largely post-hoc and architecture-specific, they provide inconsistent protection across diverse architectures and release formats in practice. To close this gap, we propose \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$, an architecture-agnostic protection framework that encodes protection into the update during fine-tuning, regardless of whether they are released as adapters or full models. Instead of relying on architecture-dependent approaches, \textsc{Trap}$^{2}$ uses weight re-scaling as a simple proxy for the merging process. It keeps released weights effective in standalone use, but degrades them under re-scaling that often arises in merging, undermining unauthorized merging.

Abstract: Current LLM post-training methods optimize complete reasoning trajectories through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, a closer examination reveals a fundamental gap: this approach does not align with how humans actually solve problems. Human cognition naturally decomposes problem-solving into two distinct stages: first acquiring abstract strategies (i.e., meta-knowledge) that generalize across problems, then adapting them to specific instances. In contrast, by treating complete trajectories as basic units, current methods are inherently problem-centric, entangling abstract strategies with problem-specific execution. To address this misalignment, we propose a cognitively-inspired framework that explicitly mirrors the two-stage human cognitive process. Specifically, Chain-of-Meta-Thought (CoMT) focuses supervised learning on abstract reasoning patterns without specific executions, enabling acquisition of generalizable strategies. Confidence-Calibrated Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) then optimizes task adaptation via confidence-aware rewards on intermediate steps, preventing overconfident errors from cascading and improving execution reliability. Experiments across four models and eight benchmarks show 2.19\% and 4.63\% improvements in-distribution and out-of-distribution respectively over standard methods, while reducing training time by 65-70% and token consumption by 50%, demonstrating that aligning post-training with human cognitive principles yields not only superior generalization but also enhanced training efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising paradigm for optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in complex reasoning tasks. However, traditional outcome-based RL approaches often suffer from reward sparsity and inefficient credit assignment, as coarse-grained scalar rewards fail to identify specific erroneous steps within long-horizon trajectories. This ambiguity frequently leads to "process hallucinations", where models reach correct answers through flawed logic or redundant retrieval steps. Although recent process-aware approaches attempt to mitigate this via static preference learning or heuristic reward shaping, they often lack the on-policy exploration capabilities required to decouple step-level credit from global outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose ProRAG, a process-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to integrate learned step-level supervision into the online optimization loop. Our framework consists of four stages: (1) Supervised Policy Warmup to initialize the model with a structured reasoning format; (2) construction of an MCTS-based Process Reward Model (PRM) to quantify intermediate reasoning quality; (3) PRM-Guided Reasoning Refinement to align the policy with fine-grained process preferences; and (4) Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning with a dual-granularity advantage mechanism. By aggregating step-level process rewards with global outcome signals, ProRAG provides precise feedback for every action. Extensive experiments on five multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ProRAG achieves superior overall performance compared to strong outcome-based and process-aware RL baselines, particularly on complex long-horizon tasks, validating the effectiveness of fine-grained process supervision. The code and model are available at https://github.com/lilinwz/ProRAG.

Abstract: The evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shifted from static retrieval pipelines to dynamic, agentic workflows where a central planner orchestrates multi-turn reasoning. However, existing paradigms face a critical dichotomy: they either optimize modules jointly within rigid, fixed-graph architectures, or empower dynamic planning while treating executors as frozen, black-box tools. We identify that this \textit{decoupled optimization} creates a ``strategic-operational mismatch,'' where sophisticated planning strategies fail to materialize due to unadapted local executors, often leading to negative performance gains despite increased system complexity. In this paper, we propose \textbf{JADE} (\textbf{J}oint \textbf{A}gentic \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{E}xecution), a unified framework for the joint optimization of planning and execution within dynamic, multi-turn workflows. By modeling the system as a cooperative multi-agent team unified under a single shared backbone, JADE enables end-to-end learning driven by outcome-based rewards. This approach facilitates \textit{co-adaptation}: the planner learns to operate within the capability boundaries of the executors, while the executors evolve to align with high-level strategic intent. Empirical results demonstrate that JADE transforms disjoint modules into a synergistic system, yielding remarkable performance improvements via joint optimization and enabling a flexible balance between efficiency and effectiveness through dynamic workflow orchestration.

Abstract: The inference overhead induced by redundant reasoning undermines the interactive experience and severely bottlenecks the deployment of Large Reasoning Models. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions tackle this problem by coupling a length penalty with outcome-based rewards. This simplistic reward weighting struggles to reconcile brevity with accuracy, as enforcing brevity may compromise critical reasoning logic. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a multi-agent RL framework that selectively penalizes redundant chunks, while preserving essential reasoning logic. Our framework, Self-Compression via MARL (SCMA), instantiates redundancy detection and evaluation through two specialized agents: \textbf{a Segmentation Agent} for decomposing the reasoning process into logical chunks, and \textbf{a Scoring Agent} for quantifying the significance of each chunk. The Segmentation and Scoring agents collaboratively define an importance-weighted length penalty during training, incentivizing \textbf{a Reasoning Agent} to prioritize essential logic without introducing inference overhead during deployment. Empirical evaluations across model scales demonstrate that SCMA reduces response length by 11.1\% to 39.0\% while boosting accuracy by 4.33\% to 10.02\%. Furthermore, ablation studies and qualitative analysis validate that the synergistic optimization within the MARL framework fosters emergent behaviors, yielding more powerful LRMs compared to vanilla RL paradigms.

Abstract: We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains.

Abstract: In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all inputs, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity of real-world data. In this work, we propose Routing the Lottery (RTL), an adaptive pruning framework that discovers multiple specialized subnetworks, called adaptive tickets, each tailored to a class, semantic cluster, or environmental condition. Across diverse datasets and tasks, RTL consistently outperforms single- and multi-model baselines in balanced accuracy and recall, while using up to 10 times fewer parameters than independent models and exhibiting semantically aligned. Furthermore, we identify subnetwork collapse, a performance drop under aggressive pruning, and introduce a subnetwork similarity score that enables label-free diagnosis of oversparsification. Overall, our results recast pruning as a mechanism for aligning model structure with data heterogeneity, paving the way toward more modular and context-aware deep learning.

Abstract: Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, it remains unclear whether large language models can reason over genuinely novel scientific information. Most evaluations score end-to-end RAG pipelines, where reasoning is confounded with retrieval and toolchain choices, and the signal is further contaminated by parametric memorization and open-web volatility. We introduce DeR2, a controlled deep-research sandbox that isolates document-grounded reasoning while preserving core difficulties of deep search: multi-step synthesis, denoising, and evidence-based conclusion making. DeR2 decouples evidence access from reasoning via four regimes--Instruction-only, Concepts (gold concepts without documents), Related-only (only relevant documents), and Full-set (relevant documents plus topically related distractors)--yielding interpretable regime gaps that operationalize retrieval loss vs. reasoning loss and enable fine-grained error attribution. To prevent parametric leakage, we apply a two-phase validation that requires parametric failure without evidence while ensuring oracle-concept solvability. To ensure reproducibility, each instance provides a frozen document library (drawn from 2023-2025 theoretical papers) with expert-annotated concepts and validated rationales. Experiments across a diverse set of state-of-the-art foundation models reveal substantial variation and significant headroom: some models exhibit mode-switch fragility, performing worse with the Full-set than with Instruction-only, while others show structural concept misuse, correctly naming concepts but failing to execute them as procedures.

Abstract: Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.

Abstract: Web agents have demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of web-based tasks. However, existing research on the effect of environmental variation has mostly focused on robustness to adversarial attacks, with less attention to agents' preferences in benign scenarios. Although early studies have examined how textual attributes influence agent behavior, a systematic understanding of how visual attributes shape agent decision-making remains limited. To address this, we introduce VAF, a controlled evaluation pipeline for quantifying how webpage Visual Attribute Factors influence web-agent decision-making. Specifically, VAF consists of three stages: (i) variant generation, which ensures the variants share identical semantics as the original item while only differ in visual attributes; (ii) browsing interaction, where agents navigate the page via scrolling and clicking the interested item, mirroring how human users browse online; (iii) validating through both click action and reasoning from agents, which we use the Target Click Rate and Target Mention Rate to jointly evaluate the effect of visual attributes. By quantitatively measuring the decision-making difference between the original and variant, we identify which visual attributes influence agents' behavior most. Extensive experiments, across 8 variant families (48 variants total), 5 real-world websites (including shopping, travel, and news browsing), and 4 representative web agents, show that background color contrast, item size, position, and card clarity have a strong influence on agents' actions, whereas font styling, text color, and item image clarity exhibit minor effects.

Abstract: AI research has traditionally prioritised algorithmic performance, such as optimising accuracy in machine learning or runtime in automated planning. The emerging paradigm of Green AI challenges this by recognising energy consumption as a critical performance dimension. Despite the high computational demands of automated planning, its energy efficiency has received little attention. This gap is particularly salient given the modular planning structure, in which domain models are specified independently of algorithms. On the other hand, this separation also enables systematic analysis of energy usage through domain model design. We empirically investigate how domain model characteristics affect the energy consumption of classical planners. We introduce a domain model configuration framework that enables controlled variation of features, such as element ordering, action arity, and dead-end states. Using five benchmark domains and five state-of-the-art planners, we analyse energy and runtime impacts across 32 domain variants per benchmark. Results demonstrate that domain-level modifications produce measurable energy differences across planners, with energy consumption not always correlating with runtime.

Abstract: Recent work has explored optimizing LLM collaboration through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, most MARL fine-tuning approaches rely on predefined execution protocols, which often require centralized execution. Decentralized LLM collaboration is more appealing in practice, as agents can run inference in parallel with flexible deployments. Also, current approaches use Monte Carlo methods for fine-tuning, which suffer from high variance and thus require more samples to train effectively. Actor-critic methods are prevalent in MARL for dealing with these issues, so we developed Multi-Agent Actor-Critic (MAAC) methods to optimize decentralized LLM collaboration. In this paper, we analyze when and why these MAAC methods are beneficial. We propose 2 MAAC approaches, \textbf{CoLLM-CC} with a \textbf{C}entralized \textbf{C}ritic and \textbf{CoLLM-DC} with \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{C}ritics. Our experiments across writing, coding, and game-playing domains show that Monte Carlo methods and CoLLM-DC can achieve performance comparable to CoLLM-CC in short-horizon and dense-reward settings. However, they both underperform CoLLM-CC on long-horizon or sparse-reward tasks, where Monte Carlo methods require substantially more samples and CoLLM-DC struggles to converge.

Abstract: Recent work identifies a stated-revealed (SvR) preference gap in language models (LMs): a mismatch between the values models endorse and the choices they make in context. Existing evaluations rely heavily on binary forced-choice prompting, which entangles genuine preferences with artifacts of the elicitation protocol. We systematically study how elicitation protocols affect SvR correlation across 24 LMs. Allowing neutrality and abstention during stated preference elicitation allows us to exclude weak signals, substantially improving Spearman's rank correlation ($ρ$) between volunteered stated preferences and forced-choice revealed preferences. However, further allowing abstention in revealed preferences drives $ρ$ to near-zero or negative values due to high neutrality rates. Finally, we find that system prompt steering using stated preferences during revealed preference elicitation does not reliably improve SvR correlation on AIRiskDilemmas. Together, our results show that SvR correlation is highly protocol-dependent and that preference elicitation requires methods that account for indeterminate preferences.

Abstract: Event stream data is a critical resource for fine-grained analysis across various domains, including financial transactions, system operations, and sports. In sports, it is actively used for fine-grained analyses such as quantifying player contributions and identifying tactical patterns. However, the reliability of these models is fundamentally limited by inherent data quality issues that cause logical inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect event ordering or missing events). To this end, this study proposes VERSA (Verified Event Data Format for Reliable Soccer Analytics), a systematic verification framework that ensures the integrity of event stream data within the soccer domain. VERSA is based on a state-transition model that defines valid event sequences, thereby enabling the automatic detection and correction of anomalous patterns within the event stream data. Notably, our examination of event data from the K League 1 (2024 season), provided by Bepro, detected that 18.81% of all recorded events exhibited logical inconsistencies. Addressing such integrity issues, our experiments demonstrate that VERSA significantly enhances cross-provider consistency, ensuring stable and unified data representation across heterogeneous sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate that data refined by VERSA significantly improves the robustness and performance of a downstream task called VAEP, which evaluates player contributions. These results highlight that the verification process is highly effective in increasing the reliability of data-driven analysis.

Abstract: Contemporary software architectures struggle to support autonomous agents whose reasoning is adaptive, probabilistic, and context-dependent, while system integration remains dominated by static interfaces and deterministic contracts. This paper introduces Liquid Interfaces, a coordination paradigm in which interfaces are not persistent technical artifacts, but ephemeral relational events that emerge through intention articulation and semantic negotiation at runtime.We formalize this model and present the Liquid Interface Protocol (LIP),which governs intention-driven interaction, negotiated execution, and enforce ephemerality under semantic uncertainty. We further discuss the governance implications of this approach and describe a reference architecture that demonstrates practical feasibility. Liquid Interfaces provide a principled foundation for adaptive coordination in agent-based systems

Abstract: AI agent inference is driving an inference heavy datacenter future and exposes bottlenecks beyond compute - especially memory capacity, memory bandwidth and high-speed interconnect. We introduce two metrics - Operational Intensity (OI) and Capacity Footprint (CF) - that jointly explain regimes the classic roofline analysis misses, including the memory capacity wall. Across agentic workflows (chat, coding, web use, computer use) and base model choices (GQA/MLA, MoE, quantization), OI/CF can shift dramatically, with long context KV cache making decode highly memory bound. These observations motivate disaggregated serving and system level heterogeneity: specialized prefill and decode accelerators, broader scale up networking, and decoupled compute-memory enabled by optical I/O. We further hypothesize agent-hardware co design, multiple inference accelerators within one system, and high bandwidth, large capacity memory disaggregation as foundations for adaptation to evolving OI/CF. Together, these directions chart a path to sustain efficiency and capability for large scale agentic AI inference.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents focus on task completion under idealistic settings but overlook reliability in real-world, user-facing applications. In domains, such as in-car voice assistants, users often issue incomplete or ambiguous requests, creating intrinsic uncertainty that agents must manage through dialogue, tool use, and policy adherence. We introduce CAR-bench, a benchmark for evaluating consistency, uncertainty handling, and capability awareness in multi-turn, tool-using LLM agents in an in-car assistant domain. The environment features an LLM-simulated user, domain policies, and 58 interconnected tools spanning navigation, productivity, charging, and vehicle control. Beyond standard task completion, CAR-bench introduces Hallucination tasks that test agents' limit-awareness under missing tools or information, and Disambiguation tasks that require resolving uncertainty through clarification or internal information gathering. Baseline results reveal large gaps between occasional and consistent success on all task types. Even frontier reasoning LLMs achieve less than 50% consistent pass rate on Disambiguation tasks due to premature actions, and frequently violate policies or fabricate information to satisfy user requests in Hallucination tasks, underscoring the need for more reliable and self-aware LLM agents in real-world settings.

Abstract: Agentic AI enables LLM to dynamically reason, plan, and interact with tools to solve complex tasks. However, agentic workflows often require many iterative reasoning steps and tool invocations, leading to significant operational expense, end-to-end latency and failures due to hallucinations. This work introduces Agent Workflow Optimization (AWO), a framework that identifies and optimizes redundant tool execution patterns to improve the efficiency and robustness of agentic workflows. AWO analyzes existing workflow traces to discover recurring sequences of tool calls and transforms them into meta-tools, which are deterministic, composite tools that bundle multiple agent actions into a single invocation. Meta-tools bypass unnecessary intermediate LLM reasoning steps and reduce operational cost while also shortening execution paths, leading to fewer failures. Experiments on two agentic AI benchmarks show that AWO reduces the number of LLM calls up to 11.9% while also increasing the task success rate by up to 4.2 percent points.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in many domains, including numerous safety-critical applications. However, for complex systems found in the real world, or when data already exist, defining the underlying environmental conditions is extremely challenging. This often results in an incomplete description of the environment in which the AI-based system must operate. Nevertheless, this description, called the Operational Design Domain (ODD), is required in many domains for the certification of AI-based systems. Traditionally, the ODD is created in the early stages of the development process, drawing on sophisticated expert knowledge and related standards. This paper presents a novel Safety-by-Design method to a posteriori define the ODD from previously collected data using a multi-dimensional kernel-based representation. This approach is validated through both Monte Carlo methods and a real-world aviation use case for a future safety-critical collision-avoidance system. Moreover, by defining under what conditions two ODDs are equal, the paper shows that the data-driven ODD can equal the original, underlying hidden ODD of the data. Utilizing the novel, Safe-by-Design kernel-based ODD enables future certification of data-driven, safety-critical AI-based systems.

Abstract: Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.

Abstract: Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.
