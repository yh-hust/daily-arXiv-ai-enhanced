We introduce LM Fight\nArena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by\npitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,\na task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential\ndecision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and\nclosed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character\nto ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames\nand state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM\nFight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment\nof an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work\nintroduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI\nevaluation and interactive entertainment."}

However, existing approaches primarily focus on\ninformation processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of\npersuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.\nIn SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on\nconvincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this\nlimitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg\ncompetition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically\ninfluences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we\npropose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize\nutterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across\nthree diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform\nbaselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents\ncapable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios\nrequiring persuasive communication."}
