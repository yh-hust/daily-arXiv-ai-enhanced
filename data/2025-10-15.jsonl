Kaguya TC (Terrain\nCamera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude\ninaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression\nartifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps\ngenerated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of\ncompression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression\nbehavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise\npatterns, especially in darker regions.

In this work, we propose the\nDiscriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address\nthese challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet\nefficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)\nnetwork, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a\nlightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each\nincremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new\nclasses, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the\ncurrent model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a\nresult, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different\nincremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable\ncomparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the\nDecoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and\nnegative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor.

DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability\ndistributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically\ncoherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data.

Unlike conventional generative models that\nrely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous\nflow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the\ndirect regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in\nthe context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly\nemerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from\ninherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our\nframework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their\ncorresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without\nrequiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while\nutilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.\nThese results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool\nfor MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments."}

So, image quality and realism degrade when\nrendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,\nwe build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital\nhumans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,\nMVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and\ngenerates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to\n360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this\nmodel into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach\nsignificantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of\ngenerated avatars compared to previous methods."}

Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use\nthe last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train\nlarge unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands\nsubstantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its\naccessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model\nconditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a\nunified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention\nPooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level\ndetails from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion\ngenerative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion\narchitectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of\nvisual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We\npropose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),\nwhich conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens\ngenerated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the\nalignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning\ncapabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In\naddition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for\ngeneration, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits\ntremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image\nediting, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating\nthe unified encoder design of UniFusion."}

The key idea behind our\nmethod is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image\ncompression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic\ncomplexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between\nthe responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we\nintroduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that\nautomatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.\nCompared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the\nnumber of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically\nadapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of\nvision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,\nand OCR capabilities.

In face of these challenges, we\nintroduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.\nOur CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable\nsingle-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly\nlearned.

However,\nVLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is\nsupervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their\nrepresentational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose\n\\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to\npredict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that\ncompels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.\nWe showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA\narchetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual\ntokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual\nfeatures. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we\nintroduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for\nreal-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a\n680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly\noutperforms BEV and VLA baselines.

On\nbenchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or\nexceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot\nsetting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use\nspecial tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the\nmodel's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate\nprediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate\nhigh-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically\nrich supervision for training; \\3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage\ntraining process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with\nGRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages\ngeometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous\ncoordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable\nbehaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature\nof the initial SFT stage.

To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,\nthe first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web\nsearches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.\nSpecifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops\nof the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively\nadapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling\nself-reflection and self-correction.
