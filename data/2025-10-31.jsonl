Despite their\nstrong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing\ntasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the\nlatent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in\noutputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have\nattempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based\napproaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal\nediting quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output.

The Information-Theoretic Imperative\n(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must\nminimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the\nevolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.\nThe Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression\nmechanically selects for generative, causal models through\nexception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather\nthan a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:\nfrom survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,\nefficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality\nalignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or\nevolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically\nnecessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework\nyields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as\napproach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution\ngeneralization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from\ncorrelational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across\nabstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that\ntrack representational complexity.

We apply it to an\nintra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of\nframes, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate\nvarious image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL\nand introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model\nperformance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation\nstrategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist\nand elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It\noutperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and\nconventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice\ncoefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential\nof FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well\nsuited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce."}

This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and\ninformation decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal\ninformation, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural\ndetails. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion\nmodel is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical\nguidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at\ndifferent stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the\nintrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nfusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple\ndatasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics.

Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity.

Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality.

Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a\npromising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce\nimmersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance\nthis technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically\nbased rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to\nrepurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,\nand PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize\nappearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we\npresent OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and\nefficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for\na broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,\ngeneration, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic\npanorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse\nindoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene\ngeneration, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic\nvirtual world generation."}

An Empirical Study with the MME-CoF Benchmark", "comment": "Project Page: https://video-cof.github.io", "summary": "Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent\nvideos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond\nrealistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual\nperception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still\nremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging\nvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are\nnot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging\nsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\nProject page: https://video-cof.github.io"}
