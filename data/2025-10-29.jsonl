In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to\novercome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates\nthe weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two\nlow-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by\nintroducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the\nresulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,\nenabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant\nweights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that\nencourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their\nimportance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted\non classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different\npre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA\nperformance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.\n90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.\nCompared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%\nacross models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M.

Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization\nacross heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing\nmethods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall\nshort when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic\npatterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as\nundifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent\nstructural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and\nmodular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and\ntrend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.\nSpecifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection\nmodule that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.\nIn parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment\nlevel via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a\nmasked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are\ncombined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while\ntracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains\ndemonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."}

To answer this question, we quantify the representation\ninterpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable\nsemantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,\nonly the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas\nthe uninterpretable part leads to information loss.

In this\npaper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and\nSAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural\ndifferences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement\nacross consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the\nfirst cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual\nsemantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a\ntarget-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly\nassigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization.

We revisit this\nlimitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional\ndifferences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space\nand the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform\nsmooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with\ndiscontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor\nperturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade\nframeworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during\ndetection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization.

However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity\nof labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and\nsensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown\npromise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual\nand textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains\nsuboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific\nsemantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically\nexplore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for\nfew-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several\nrepresentative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context\nOptimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating\nConstraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from\nstatic context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,\nmulti-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically\nregularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these\nprompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with\nhand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.\nThrough extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,\nincluding cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt\nlearning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.\nNotably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust\ncross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable\nand efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial\nimagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field."}

However, existing editing methods often lack\neffective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve\nmore customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the\nMM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key\ntokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias\nas representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between\neach token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing\nsignals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a\nsimple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens\nto modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing\ninstruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing\nintensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image\nediting frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four\nlines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality.

Language tokens are\nsemantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens\nexhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert\nspecialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework\nfeaturing a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert\nspecialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition\nimage tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing\naccording to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional\nimage tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on\nsemantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent\nspace enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for\nincorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is\ncrucial for vision MoE.
