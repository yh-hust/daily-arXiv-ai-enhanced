However, existing evaluations rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of difficulty relative to varying model capacities. Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that while adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity, it notably decouples from final accuracy. Conversely, key step coverage aligns with performance, though tool effectiveness remains highly inconsistent across model architectures."}

However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use."}

Following this strategy and to overcome the limitations of existing landmarking techniques, we propose Landmark Point Transformer (LmPT), a method for automatic anatomical landmark detection on point clouds that can leverage homologous bones from different species for translational research. The LmPT model incorporates a conditioning mechanism that enables adaptability to different input types to conduct cross-species learning.

However, these agents often struggle in specialized, tool-intensive domains that demand long-horizon execution, tight coordination across modalities, and strict adherence to implicit tool constraints. Earth Observation (EO) tasks exemplify this challenge due to the multi-modal and multi-temporal data inputs, as well as the requirements of geo-knowledge constraints (spectrum library, spatial reasoning, etc): many high-level plans can be derailed by subtle execution errors that propagate through a pipeline and invalidate final results. A core difficulty is that existing agents lack a mechanism to learn fine-grained, tool-level expertise from interaction. Without such expertise, they cannot reliably configure tool parameters or recover from mid-execution failures, limiting their effectiveness in complex EO workflows. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{GeoEvolver}, a self-evolving multi-agent system~(MAS) that enables LLM agents to acquire EO expertise through structured interaction without any parameter updates. GeoEvolver decomposes each query into independent sub-goals via a retrieval-augmented multi-agent orchestrator, then explores diverse tool-parameter configurations at the sub-goal level. Successful patterns and root-cause attribution from failures are then distilled in an evolving memory bank that provides in-context demonstrations for future queries. Experiments on three tool-integrated EO benchmarks show that GeoEvolver consistently improves end-to-end task success, with an average gain of 12\\% across multiple LLM backbones, demonstrating that EO expertise can emerge progressively from efficient, fine-grained interactions with the environment."}

Effective anonymization relies on the exhaustive localization of every individual; even a single missed detection necessitates extensive manual correction. However, existing approaches face two critical scalability bottlenecks: (1) they usually require manual annotations of each new clinical site for high accuracy; (2) while multi-camera setups have been widely adopted to address single-view ambiguity, camera calibration is typically required whenever cameras are repositioned. To address these problems, we propose a novel self-supervised multi-view video anonymization framework consisting of whole-body person detection and whole-body pose estimation, without annotation or camera calibration. Our core strategy is to enhance the single-view detector by \"retrieving\" false negatives using temporal and multi-view context, and conducting self-supervised domain adaptation. We first run an off-the-shelf whole-body person detector in each view with a low-score threshold to gather candidate detections. Then, we retrieve the low-score false negatives that exhibit consistency with the high-score detections via tracking and self-supervised uncalibrated multi-view association. These recovered detections serve as pseudo labels to iteratively fine-tune the whole-body detector. Finally, we apply whole-body pose estimation on each detected person, and fine-tune the pose model using its own high-score predictions. Experiments on the 4D-OR dataset of simulated surgeries and our dataset of real surgeries show the effectiveness of our approach achieving over 97% recall. Moreover, we train a real-time whole-body detector using our pseudo labels, achieving comparable performance and highlighting our method's practical applicability.

We introduce a benchmark of curated metrics and a dataset annotated for eight demographic attributes (31 categorical values) across two domains: movies and music. Through in-depth case studies, we quantify predictive uncertainty (via entropy) and demonstrate that Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes; measured similarity-based gaps are SNSR at 0.1363 and SNSV at 0.0507. These disparities persist under prompt perturbations such as typographical errors and multilingual inputs. We further integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline to reveal personality-linked bias patterns and expose trade-offs between personalization and group fairness. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology for RecLLMs, present empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and introduce a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations.

Inspired by human active perception, we introduce ViThinker, a framework that enables vision-language models to autonomously generate decision (query) tokens triggering the synthesis of expert-aligned visual features on demand. ViThinker internalizes vision-expert capabilities during training, performing generative mental simulation during inference without external tool calls. Through a two-stage curriculum: first distilling frozen experts into model parameters, then learning task-driven querying via sparsity penalties, i.e., ViThinker discovers minimal sufficient perception for each reasoning step.

PeerRank treats evaluation as a multi-agent process where each model participates symmetrically as task designer, respondent, and evaluator, while removing biased judgments. In a large-scale study over 12 commercially available models and 420 autonomously generated questions, PeerRank produces stable, discriminative rankings and reveals measurable identity and presentation biases. Rankings are robust, and mean peer scores agree with Elo. We further validate PeerRank on TruthfulQA and GSM8K, where peer scores correlate with objective accuracy.

While ROCO provides large-scale image-caption pairs, it does not specify how references should be selected for contrastive reasoning, and naive retrieval frequently yields near-duplicate figures from the same document. To address this gap, we release a reproducible reference selection protocol and curated reference bank that enable a systematic study of contrastive retrieval in medical image reasoning. Building on these contrastive evidence sets, we propose Counterfactual-Contrastive Inference, a confidence-aware reasoning framework that performs structured pairwise visual comparisons and aggregates evidence using margin-based decision rules with faithful abstention.

Existing faithfulness metrics have critical limitations, typically relying on identifying unfaithfulness via adversarial prompting or detecting reasoning errors. These methods overlook the predictive value of explanations. We introduce Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG), a general and scalable metric based on the idea that a faithful explanation should allow an observer to learn a model's decision-making criteria, and thus better predict its behavior on related inputs. We evaluate 18 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, e.g., Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, and Claude 4.5, on 7,000 counterfactuals from popular datasets covering health, business, and ethics. We find self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations also provide more predictive information than explanations generated by external models, even when those models are stronger. This implies an advantage from self-knowledge that external explanation methods cannot replicate. Our approach also reveals that, across models, 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading. Despite their imperfections, we show a positive case for self-explanations: they encode information that helps predict model behavior."}

While vision-language models have advanced single-image report generation and visual grounding, no existing method combines these capabilities for temporal change detection. We introduce Temporal Radiology with Anatomical Change Explanation (TRACE), the first model that jointly performs temporal comparison, change classification, and spatial localization. Given a prior and current chest X-ray, TRACE generates natural language descriptions of interval changes (worsened, improved, stable) while grounding each finding with bounding box coordinates. TRACE demonstrates effective spatial localization with over 90% grounding accuracy, establishing a foundation for this challenging new task. Our ablation study uncovers an emergent capability: change detection arises only when temporal comparison and spatial grounding are jointly learned, as neither alone enables meaningful change detection. This finding suggests that grounding provides a spatial attention mechanism essential for temporal reasoning."}

Unlike existing uniform prompting approaches, CoS employs three distinct reasoning modes: (1) computational flow with self-consistency for mathematical problems, (2) symbolic state tracking with JSON representations for spatial reasoning, and (3) hybrid fact-extraction for multi-hop inference. Through comprehensive evaluation on GSM8K, StrategyQA, and bAbI benchmarks using four state-of-the-art models (Gemma-3 27B, LLaMA-3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, and Qwen-2.5 14B), we demonstrate that CoS achieves 71.5% accuracy on GSM8K (1.0% absolute improvement), 90.0% on StrategyQA (2.5% improvement), and 19.0% on bAbI (65.2% relative improvement) compared to the strongest baselines. The analysis reveals that problem-specific mode selection is crucial, with computational mode achieving 81.2% accuracy when correctly applied to mathematical problems, while misrouting leads to 0% accuracy. We provide detailed algorithms for mode selection, state tracking, and answer extraction, establishing CoS as an effective approach for improving LLM reasoning without additional training. The framework provides superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency compared to Self-Consistency, achieving comparable performance at 54% lower computational cost."}

Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection is challenging, since there are many HFCs along with targets, such as bright corners, broken clouds, and other clutters. Current learning-based methods rely on the powerful capabilities of deep networks, but neglect explicit modeling and discriminative representation learning of various HFCs, which is important to distinguish targets from other HFCs. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dynamic high-frequency convolution (DHiF) to translate the discriminative modeling process into the generation of a dynamic local filter bank. Especially, DHiF is sensitive to HFCs, owing to the dynamic parameters of its generated filters being symmetrically adjusted within a zero-centered range according to Fourier transformation properties. Combining with standard convolution operations, DHiF can adaptively and dynamically process different HFC regions and capture their distinctive grayscale variation characteristics for discriminative representation learning. DHiF functions as a drop-in replacement for standard convolution and can be used in arbitrary SIRST detection networks without significant decrease in computational efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of our DHiF, we conducted extensive experiments across different SIRST detection networks on real-scene datasets. Compared to other state-of-the-art convolution operations, DHiF exhibits superior detection performance with promising improvement. Codes are available at https://github.com/TinaLRJ/DHiF."}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, they are not suited for precise numerical optimization in AMS sizing. To address this gap, we propose AutoSizer, a reflective LLM-driven meta-optimization framework that unifies circuit understanding, adaptive search-space construction, and optimization orchestration in a closed loop. It employs a two-loop optimization framework, with an inner loop for circuit sizing and an outer loop that analyzes optimization dynamics and constraints to iteratively refine the search space from simulation feedback. We further introduce AMS-SizingBench, an open benchmark comprising 24 diverse AMS circuits in SKY130 CMOS technology, designed to evaluate adaptive optimization policies under realistic simulator-based constraints. AutoSizer experimentally achieves higher solution quality, faster convergence, and higher success rate across varying circuit difficulties, outperforming both traditional optimization methods and existing LLM-based agents."}

We propose STEER (Steerable Tuning via Evolutionary Ensemble Refinement), a training-free framework that reintroduces this tunable control. STEER constructs a population of natural-language personas through an offline, constrained quality-diversity search that promotes behavioral coverage while enforcing minimum safety, reasoning, and stability thresholds. At inference time, STEER exposes a single, interpretable control parameter that maps a user-specified risk percentile to a selected persona, yielding a monotonic adjustment of decision conservativeness. On two clinical triage benchmarks, STEER achieves broader behavioral coverage compared to temperature-based sampling and static persona ensembles. Compared to a representative post-training method, STEER maintains substantially higher accuracy on unambiguous urgent cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous decisions. These results demonstrate STEER as a safety-preserving paradigm for risk control, capable of steering behavior without compromising domain competence."}

To adaptively experience Mixed Reality (MR) content based on each user's space, it is essential to generate a 3D scene that reflects the real-world layout by compactly capturing the semantic cues of the surroundings. Prior works struggled to fully capture the contextual relationship between objects or mainly focused on synthesizing diverse shapes, making it challenging to generate 3D scenes aligned with object arrangements. We address these challenges by designing a graph network with cross-check feature attention for scene graph prediction and constructing a graph-variational autoencoder (graph-VAE), which consists of a joint shape and layout block for 3D scene generation. Experiments on the 3RScan/3DSSG and SG-FRONT datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, even in complex indoor environments and under challenging scene graph constraints.

We define a simple instability signal that combines consecutive-step distributional shift (JSD) and uncertainty (entropy), summarize each trace by its peak instability strength, and show that this signal reliably predicts failure. Across GSM8K and HotpotQA, instability strength predicts wrong answers with above-chance AUC and yields monotonic bucket-level accuracy decline at scale across model sizes. Crucially, we show that instability is not uniformly harmful: early instability can reflect subsequent stabilization and a correct final answer (\\emph{corrective instability}), whereas late instability is more often followed by failure (\\emph{destructive instability}), even at comparable peak magnitudes, indicating that recoverability depends not only on how strongly the distribution changes but also on when such changes occur relative to the remaining decoding horizon.

Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains.

We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding. Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior. Experiments show that hierarchical cross-domain alignment enables fine-grained, visually grounded image-text representations to emerge without explicit region-level supervision."}

Recent progress in Gaussian-based representations has significantly improved real-time rendering quality, yet existing methods still struggle to maintain a balance between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in both representation and optimization. To address this, we present SharpTimeGS, a lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of both static and dynamic regions under a unified representation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable lifespan parameter that reformulates temporal visibility from a Gaussian-shaped decay into a flat-top profile, allowing primitives to remain consistently active over their intended duration and avoiding redundant densification. In addition, the learned lifespan modulates each primitives' motion, reducing drift in long-lived static points while retaining unrestricted motion for short-lived dynamic ones. This effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity. Moreover, we design a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy that mitigates optimization imbalance between static and dynamic regions by allocating more capacity to regions with pronounced motion while keeping static areas compact and stable. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while supporting real-time rendering up to 4K resolution at 100 FPS on one RTX 4090."}

Video-OPD optimizes trajectories sampled directly from the current policy, thereby preserving alignment between training and inference distributions, while a frontier teacher supplies dense, token-level supervision via a reverse KL divergence objective. This formulation preserves the on-policy property critical for mitigating distributional shift, while converting sparse, episode-level feedback into fine-grained, step-wise learning signals.

To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), a benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question extracted from a published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLMs backbones like gpt-5 on FIRE-Bench.

By extending the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model--an abstraction of LLMs that quantifies the information flow required to solve a task--we prove lower bounds on the CoT tokens required for three canonical BAPO-hard tasks: binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability. We show that each requires $Ω(n)$ reasoning tokens when the input size is $n$. We complement these results with matching or near-matching upper bounds via explicit constructions. Finally, our experiments with frontier reasoning models show approximately linear reasoning token scaling on these tasks and failures when constrained to smaller reasoning budgets, consistent with our theoretical lower bounds.

Under this view, constructing context via full-code snapshots constitutes a suboptimal M-step, as redundant implement details dilutes core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution. To address this, we propose DeltaEvolve, a momentum-driven evolutionary framework that replaces full-code history with structured semantic delta capturing how and why modifications between successive nodes affect performance. As programs are often decomposable, semantic delta usually contains many effective components which are transferable and more informative to drive improvement. By organizing semantic delta through multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism, input tokens are further reduced.

Finally, we employ hybrid VLM and two-tower ANN architectures to build authority-aware interlinking structures that propagate signals across billions of visual assets. Deployed at scale across billions of images and tens of millions of collections, GEO delivers 20\\% organic traffic growth contributing to multi-million monthly active user (MAU) growth, demonstrating a principled pathway for visual platforms to thrive in the generative search era."}

We present a neurosymbolic approach to solving these problems: given a hypothesized solution rule for a Bongard problem, we leverage LLMs to generate parameterized programmatic representations for the rule and perform parameter fitting using Bayesian optimization. We evaluate our method on classifying Bongard problem images given the ground truth rule, as well as on solving the problems from scratch."}

Recent methods frequently leverage pretrained networks to calculate perceptual losses or utilize pretrained feature spaces. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of pretrained networks by incorporating innovative self-supervised learning techniques and enforcing consistency between discriminators during GAN training. Our proposed method, named HP-GAN, effectively exploits neural network priors through two primary strategies: FakeTwins and discriminator consistency. FakeTwins leverages pretrained networks as encoders to compute a self-supervised loss and applies this through the generated images to train the generator, thereby enabling the generation of more diverse and high quality images. Additionally, we introduce a consistency mechanism between discriminators that evaluate feature maps extracted from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) feature networks. Discriminator consistency promotes coherent learning among discriminators and enhances training robustness by aligning their assessments of image quality. Our extensive evaluation across seventeen datasets-including scenarios with large, small, and limited data, and covering a variety of image domains-demonstrates that HP-GAN consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), achieving significant improvements in image diversity and quality.

We find that a small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well and that most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning strategies than humans who seem to account for unmentioned latent factors in their probability judgments. Furthermore, most LLMs do not mirror the characteristic human collider biases of weak explaining away and Markov violations. We probe LLMs' causal judgment robustness under (i) semantic abstraction and (ii) prompt overloading (injecting irrelevant text), and find that chain-of-thought (CoT) increases robustness for many LLMs. Together, this divergence suggests LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic -- highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment."}

A significant challenge, however, is their prohibitive inference cost when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods that primarily focus on semantic relevance often discard tokens that are crucial for spatial reasoning. We address this gap through a novel insight into \\emph{how LVLMs process spatial reasoning}. Specifically, we reveal that LVLMs implicitly establish visual coordinate systems through Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), where specific token positions serve as \\textbf{implicit visual coordinates} (IVC tokens) that are essential for spatial reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{IVC-Prune}, a training-free, prompt-aware pruning strategy that retains both IVC tokens and semantically relevant foreground tokens. IVC tokens are identified by theoretically analyzing the mathematical properties of RoPE, targeting positions at which its rotation matrices approximate identity matrix or the $90^\\circ$ rotation matrix. Foreground tokens are identified through a robust two-stage process: semantic seed discovery followed by contextual refinement via value-vector similarity.

We further validate the proposed model through two controlled experiments: a random-generation task demonstrating constrained planning under human prompts and increasing planning strength as self-generated context accumulates, and a Gaussian-sampling task showing reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences. These findings provide a theoretical explanation along with empirical evidence for characterizing how LLMs plan ahead during inference."}

However, most existing 3D human pose estimation datasets primarily focus on single-person scenes or are collected in controlled laboratory environments, which restricts their relevance to real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce JRDB-Pose3D, which captures multi-human indoor and outdoor environments from a mobile robotic platform. JRDB-Pose3D provides rich 3D human pose annotations for such complex and dynamic scenes, including SMPL-based pose annotations with consistent body-shape parameters and track IDs for each individual over time. JRDB-Pose3D contains, on average, 5-10 human poses per frame, with some scenes featuring up to 35 individuals simultaneously. The proposed dataset presents unique challenges, including frequent occlusions, truncated bodies, and out-of-frame body parts, which closely reflect real-world environments. Moreover, JRDB-Pose3D inherits all available annotations from the JRDB dataset, such as 2D pose, information about social grouping, activities, and interactions, full-scene semantic masks with consistent human- and object-level tracking, and detailed annotations for each individual, such as age, gender, and race, making it a holistic dataset for a wide range of downstream perception and human-centric understanding tasks."}

To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a novel inference framework that predicts segment boundaries by solving a principled optimization problem that balances proposal coverage and segment compactness. We derive a closed-form solution for this problem and rigorously analyze the optimality conditions under varying penalty regimes. Beyond its theoretical foundations, GBO offers several practical advantages: it is training-free and compatible with both single-Gaussian and mixture-based proposal architectures. Our experiments show that GBO significantly improves localization, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks.

We propose Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP), a reasoning-aware active distillation framework that externalizes the teacher's decision process as a directed acyclic graph and mirrors it with modular concept predictors in the student. GCP enhances sample efficiency through a graph-aware acquisition strategy that targets uncertainty and disagreement at critical reasoning nodes. Additionally, it improves training stability and efficiency by performing targeted sub-module retraining, which attributes downstream loss to specific concept predictors and updates only the most influential modules.

With recent large-scale foundation models showing strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks including classification and segmentation, there has been interest in using the internal feature maps of these models for the semantic correspondence task. Recent works observe that features from DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion (SD) are complementary, the former producing accurate but sparse correspondences, while the latter produces spatially consistent correspondences. As a result, current state-of-the-art methods for semantic correspondence involve combining features from both models in an ensemble. While the performance of these methods is impressive, they are computationally expensive, requiring evaluating feature maps from large-scale foundation models. In this work we take a different approach, instead replacing SD features with a superior matching algorithm which is imbued with the desirable spatial consistency property. Specifically, we replace the standard nearest neighbours matching with an optimal transport algorithm that includes a Gromov Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior. We show that we can significantly boost the performance of the DINOv2 baseline, and be competitive and sometimes surpassing state-of-the-art methods using Stable Diffusion features, while being 5--10x more efficient.

We introduce STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement, a novel holistic framework that effectively transfers LLMs' capabilities to super-tiny models. STAR consists of two core technical innovations: (1) Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD), a training objective that augments top-k forward KL divergence to suppress confidently incorrect predictions, ensuring training stability while preserving exploration capacity for downstream RL. STAR holistically synergizes these strategies within a cohesive training curriculum, enabling super-tiny models to achieve exceptional performance on complex function calling tasks; (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL), a RL mechanism that introduces a fine-grained, similarity-based reward. This provides a robust, continuous, and rich signal for better policy optimization by evaluating the similarity between generated outputs and the ground truth. Extensive experiments on challenging and renowned benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our STAR models establish SOTA in their size classes, significantly outperforming baselines. Remarkably, our 0.6B STAR model achieves the best performance among all open models under 1B, surpassing even several well-known open models at a larger scale.

We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand.

Furthermore, methods based on machine learning require a large amount of paired 2D-3D data to train and suffer from generalization issues to unseen scenarios. To address both of these issues, we propose a framework for pose estimation using diffusion models, which enables sampling from a probability distribution over plausible poses which are consistent with a 2D image.

Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers. Experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior."}

To address these challenges, We propose JobRec, a generative job recommendation framework for de-conflating preference and qualification via constrained dual-perspective reasoning. JobRec introduces a Unified Semantic Alignment Schema that aligns candidate and job attributes into structured semantic layers, and a Two-Stage Cooperative Training Strategy that learns decoupled experts to separately infer preference and qualification. Building on these experts, a Lagrangian-based Policy Alignment module optimizes recommendations under explicit eligibility requirements, enabling controllable trade-offs. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a synthetic dataset refined by experts. Experiments show that JobRec consistently outperforms strong baselines and provides improved controllability for strategy-aware professional matching."}

FSOD-VFM integrates three key components: a universal proposal network (UPN) for category-agnostic bounding box generation, SAM2 for accurate mask extraction, and DINOv2 features for efficient adaptation to new object categories. Despite the strong generalization capabilities of foundation models, the bounding boxes generated by UPN often suffer from overfragmentation, covering only partial object regions and leading to numerous small, false-positive proposals rather than accurate, complete object detections. To address this issue, we introduce a novel graph-based confidence reweighting method. In our approach, predicted bounding boxes are modeled as nodes in a directed graph, with graph diffusion operations applied to propagate confidence scores across the network. This reweighting process refines the scores of proposals, assigning higher confidence to whole objects and lower confidence to local, fragmented parts. This strategy improves detection granularity and effectively reduces the occurrence of false-positive bounding box proposals. Through extensive experiments on Pascal-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$, and CD-FSOD datasets, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance without requiring additional training. Notably, on the challenging CD-FSOD dataset, which spans multiple datasets and domains, our FSOD-VFM achieves 31.6 AP in the 10-shot setting, substantially outperforming previous training-free methods that reach only 21.4 AP.

Moreover, their specialization to particular agent settings limits adaptability across diverse agent configurations. To address these limitations, we propose Risky-Bench, a framework that enables systematic agent safety evaluation grounded in real-world deployment. Risky-Bench organizes evaluation around domain-agnostic safety principles to derive context-aware safety rubrics that delineate safety space, and systematically evaluates safety risks across this space through realistic task execution under varying threat assumptions. When applied to life-assist agent settings, Risky-Bench uncovers substantial safety risks in state-of-the-art agents under realistic execution conditions. Moreover, as a well-structured evaluation pipeline, Risky-Bench is not confined to life-assist scenarios and can be adapted to other deployment settings to construct environment-specific safety evaluations, providing an extensible methodology for agent safety assessment."}

In this work, we propose a role-separated distillation framework that explicitly disentangles the roles of distilled steps: the first step is dedicated to preserving sample diversity via a target-prediction (e.g., v-prediction) objective, while subsequent steps focus on quality refinement under the standard DMD loss, with gradients from the DMD objective blocked at the first step. We term this approach Diversity-Preserved DMD (DP-DMD), which, despite its simplicity -- no perceptual backbone, no discriminator, no auxiliary networks, and no additional ground-truth images -- preserves sample diversity while maintaining visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods in extensive text-to-image experiments."}

These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%. Finally, we translate our findings into concrete architectural design principles and framework selection guidance, and outline promising future research directions."}

Consequently, existing studies can only incorporate few KAN layers, hindering the comprehensive exploration of KANs. This study overcomes these limitations and introduces the first fully KA-based deep model, demonstrating that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning and achieve superior learning capacity. Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy. Compared to directly deeply stacked KAN, ALL U-KAN achieves 10 times reduction in parameter count and reduces memory consumption by more than 20 times, unlocking the new explorations into deep KAN architectures."}

This result relied on the assumptions that the agent is deterministic and that the environment is fully observable.\n  In this work, we remove both assumptions by extending the theorem to stochastic agents operating in partially observable environments. Fundamentally, this shows that stochastic agents cannot avoid learning their environment through the usage of randomization. We also strengthen the result by weakening the notion of generality, proving that less powerful agents already contain a model of the world in which they operate."}

This human-in-the-loop adaptation is employed in a group-activity video retrieval framework to improve its retrieval performance. Our method initially pre-trains the GAF space based on the similarity of group activities in a self-supervised manner, unlike prior work that classifies videos into pre-defined group activity classes in a supervised learning manner. Our interactive fine-tuning process updates the GAF space to allow a user to better retrieve videos similar to query videos given by the user. In this fine-tuning, our proposed data-efficient video selection process provides several videos, which are selected from a video database, to the user in order to manually label these videos as positive or negative. These labeled videos are used to update (i.e., fine-tune) the GAF space, so that the positive and negative videos move closer to and farther away from the query videos through contrastive learning.

However, their effectiveness drops sharply when certain modalities are unavailable or incomplete. Current research primarily faces two dilemmas: Prompt-based methods struggle to restore missing yet indispensable features and impair generalization of VLMs. Imputation-based approaches, lacking effective guidance, are prone to generating semantically irrelevant noise. Restoring precise semantics while sustaining VLM generalization remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a general missing modality restoration strategy in this paper. We introduce an enhanced diffusion model as a pluggable mid-stage training module to effectively restore missing features. Our strategy introduces two key innovations: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating, which adaptively leverages conditional features to steer the generation of semantically consistent features; (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning mechanism, which bridges the semantic spaces of dual encoders to achieve bidirectional alignment. Zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm our model as a robust and scalable extension for VLMs in missing modality scenarios, ensuring reliability across diverse missing rates and environments.

In this work, we propose BinaryDemoire, a binarized demoiréing framework that explicitly accommodates the frequency structure of moiré degradations. First, we introduce a moiré-aware binary gate (MABG) that extracts lightweight frequency descriptors together with activation statistics.

To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels.

In this paper, we introduce Accordion-Thinking, an end-to-end framework where LLMs learn to self-regulate the granularity of the reasoning steps through dynamic summarization. This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process."}

We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity.

To alleviate this issue, we propose FARTrack, a Fast Auto-Regressive Tracking framework. Since autoregression emphasizes the temporal nature of the trajectory sequence, it can maintain high performance while achieving efficient execution across various devices. FARTrack introduces Task-Specific Self-Distillation and Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification, designed from the perspectives of shallow-yet-accurate distillation and redundant-to-essential token optimization, respectively. Task-Specific Self-Distillation achieves model compression by distilling task-specific tokens layer by layer, enhancing the model's inference speed while avoiding suboptimal manual teacher-student layer pairs assignments. Meanwhile, Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification sequentially condenses multiple templates, avoiding additional runtime overhead while learning a temporally-global optimal sparsification strategy. FARTrack demonstrates outstanding speed and competitive performance. It delivers an AO of 70.6% on GOT-10k in real-time.

To address this, we propose Agentic Proposing, a framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through an iterative workflow of internal reflection and tool-use, we develop the Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science. Empirical results demonstrate that downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and exhibit robust cross-domain generalization. Notably, a 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves a state-of-the-art 91.6% accuracy on AIME25, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models such as GPT-5 and proving that a small volume of high-quality synthetic signals can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets."}

When adapted to vision transformers, the standard axial formulation decomposes two-dimensional spatial positions into horizontal and vertical components, implicitly restricting positional encoding to axis-aligned directions. We identify this directional constraint as a fundamental limitation of the standard axial 2D RoPE, which hinders the modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spiral RoPE, a simple yet effective extension that enables multi-directional positional encoding by partitioning embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of the patch position onto its corresponding direction, allowing spatial relationships to be encoded beyond the horizontal and vertical axes. Across a wide range of vision tasks including classification, segmentation, and generation, Spiral RoPE consistently improves performance. Qualitative analysis of attention maps further show that Spiral RoPE exhibits more concentrated activations on semantically relevant objects and better respects local object boundaries, highlighting the importance of multi-directional positional encoding in vision transformers."}

First, we introduce MeetAll, a bilingual and multimodal corpus derived from 231 enterprise meetings totaling 140 hours. Questions are injected using an enterprise informed protocol validated by domain expert review and human discriminability studies.

Technically, we build EventMind, a large-scale and scene-diverse dataset with over 500k instruction sets, providing both short and long event stream sequences to support our curriculum training strategy. We then present an adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, which adaptively compresses temporal tokens while retaining key temporal cues.

Müller", "Srdjan Vesic", "Bruno Yun"], "title": "Rejecting Arguments Based on Doubt in Structured Bipolar Argumentation", "comment": "Accepted to AAMAS 2026", "summary": "This paper develops a new approach to computational argumentation that is informed by philosophical and linguistic views. Namely, it takes into account two ideas that have received little attention in the literature on computational argumentation: First, an agent may rationally reject an argument based on mere doubt, thus not all arguments they could defend must be accepted; and, second, that it is sometimes more natural to think in terms of which individual sentences or claims an agent accepts in a debate, rather than which arguments. In order to incorporate these two ideas into a computational approach, we first define the notion of structured bipolar argumentation frameworks (SBAFs), where arguments consist of sentences and we have both an attack and a support relation between them. Then, we provide semantics for SBAFs with two features: (1) Unlike with completeness-based semantics, our semantics do not force agents to accept all defended arguments. (2) In addition to argument extensions, which give acceptable sets of arguments, we also provide semantics for language extensions that specify acceptable sets of sentences. These semantics represent reasonable positions an agent might have in a debate. Our semantics lie between the admissible and complete semantics of abstract argumentation. Further, our approach can be used to provide a new perspective on existing approaches. For instance, we can specify the conditions under which an agent can ignore support between arguments (i.e. under which the use of abstract argumentation is warranted) and we show that deductive support semantics is a special case of our approach."}

Memora organizes information via its primary abstractions that index concrete memory values and consolidate related updates into unified memory entries, while cue anchors expand retrieval access across diverse aspects of the memory and connect related memories. Building on this structure, we employ a retrieval policy that actively exploits these memory connections to retrieve relevant information beyond direct semantic similarity. Theoretically, we show that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graph (KG)-based memory systems emerge as special cases of our framework.

We investigate this limitation by testing the ability of geometric metrics to predict compositional binding across 21 vision encoders. We find that standard geometry-based statistics exhibit near-zero correlation with compositional binding. In contrast, functional sensitivity, as measured by the input-output Jacobian, reliably tracks this capability. We further provide an analytic account showing that this disparity arises from objective design, as existing losses explicitly constrain embedding geometry but leave the local input-output mapping unconstrained. These results suggest that global embedding geometry captures only a partial view of representational competence and establish functional sensitivity as a critical complementary axis for modeling composite structure."}

Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance."}

However, existing preference-based conflict models rely exclusively on three qualitative relations, namely, preference, converse, and indifference, to describe agents' attitudes towards issue pairs, which significantly limits their capacity in capturing the essence of conflict. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set. Additionally, relative loss functions built on the proposed conflict functions are employed to calculate thresholds for three-way conflict analysis. Finally, we present adjustment mechanism-based feasible strategies that simultaneously account for both adjustment magnitudes and conflict degrees, together with an algorithm for constructing such feasible strategies, and provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model."}

Simply asking \"what kind of tone do you want?\" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize.

An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text.

However, based on theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments, we observe that directly applying existing pixel-level clean-label backdoor attack methods (e.g., COMBAT) to generated images results in low attack success rates. This motivates us to move beyond pixel-level triggers and focus instead on the latent feature level. To this end, we propose InvLBA, an invisible clean-label backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation by latent perturbation. We theoretically prove that the generalization of the clean accuracy and attack success rates of InvLBA can be guaranteed. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our method improves the attack success rate by 46.43% on average, with almost no reduction in clean accuracy and high robustness against SOTA defense methods."}

We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks.

Current defensive approaches remain cumbersome, often requiring invasive model modifications, expensive training procedures or auxiliary data access. To address these threats, in this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and non-invasive defense mechanism in the spectral domain, grounded in a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between imperceptible perturbations and high-frequency spectral components. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel purification framework, termed PWAVEP, which begins by computing a spectral graph wavelet domain saliency score and local sparsity score for each point. Guided by these values, PWAVEP adopts a hierarchical strategy, it eliminates the most salient points, which are identified as hardly recoverable adversarial outliers. Simultaneously, it applies a spectral filtering process to a broader set of moderately salient points. This process leverages a graph wavelet transform to attenuate high-frequency coefficients associated with the targeted points, thereby effectively suppressing adversarial noise. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PWAVEP achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud purification.

To address this, we propose IntentRL, a framework that trains proactive agents to clarify latent user intents before starting long-horizon research. To overcome the scarcity of open-ended research data, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands a few seed samples into high-quality dialogue turns via a shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph. We further adopt a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: Stage I applies RL on offline dialogues to efficiently learn general user-interaction behavior, while Stage II uses the trained agent and a user simulator for online rollouts to strengthen adaptation to diverse user feedback. Extensive experiments show that IntentRL significantly improves both intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming the built-in clarify modules of closed-source DR agents and proactive LLM baselines."}

CompTok uses a token-conditioned diffusion decoder. By employing an InfoGAN-style objective, where we train a recognition model to predict the tokens used to condition the diffusion decoder using the decoded images, we enforce the decoder to not ignore any of the tokens. To promote compositional control, besides the original images, CompTok also trains on tokens formed by swapping token subsets between images, enabling more compositional control of the token over the decoder. As the swapped tokens between images do not have ground truth image targets, we apply a manifold constraint via an adversarial flow regularizer to keep unpaired swap generations on the natural-image distribution. The resulting tokenizer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on image class-conditioned generation, but also demonstrates properties such as swapping tokens between images to achieve high level semantic editing of an image. Additionally, we propose two metrics that measures the landscape of the token space that can be useful to describe not only the compositionality of the tokens, but also how easy to learn the landscape is for a generator to be trained on this space. We show in experiments that CompTok can improve on both of the metrics as well as supporting state-of-the-art generators for class conditioned generation."}

However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse.

Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong.

To address this issue, we propose a \\textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions.

This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops. We conclude that, while current LLMs often demonstrate sufficient knowledge and intelligence to tackle space science tasks, they remain limited by an implementation barrier, functioning as powerful domain facilitators rather than fully autonomous engineers."}

However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead."}

We find that the dimensional configuration of embedding and extraction largely determines the resulting watermarking behavior. Same-dimensional mappings preserve payload structure and support fine-grained control, while cross-dimensional mappings enable spatial or spatiotemporal localization. We instantiate DiM in the video domain, where spatiotemporal representations enable a broader set of dimension mappings. Experiments demonstrate that varying only the embedding and extraction dimensions, without architectural changes, leads to different watermarking capabilities, including spatiotemporal tamper localization, local embedding control, and recovery of temporal order under frame disruptions."}

Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario validate that our framework reduces conversational inertia and achieves performance improvements."}

However, their reliance on reconstruction-based training creates a fundamental conflict between the sharp, high-frequency attention maps of the encoder and the spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps of the decoder. We identify that this discrepancy gives rise to a vicious cycle: the noisy feature map from the encoder forces the decoder to average over possibilities and produce even blurrier outputs, while the gradient computed from blurry reconstruction maps lacks high-frequency details necessary to supervise encoder features. To break this cycle, we introduce Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) that establishes a virtuous cycle where the encoder and decoder mutually refine one another. SRL leverages the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary within the decoder output, while exploiting the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise the encoder's features. This mutual refinement process is stabilized by a warm-up phase with a slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot. By bridging the representational gap between the encoder and decoder, SRL achieves state-of-the-art results on video object-centric learning benchmarks.

Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving.

We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient.

This challenge has spurred growing interest in effective machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing specific knowledge or concepts from a model without compromising its overall generative capabilities. Among various approaches, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective and efficient method for fine-tuning models toward targeted unlearning. However, LoRA-based methods often exhibit limited adaptability to concept semantics and struggle to balance removing closely related concepts with maintaining generalization across broader meanings. Moreover, these methods face scalability challenges when multiple concepts must be erased simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce UnHype, a framework that incorporates hypernetworks into single- and multi-concept LoRA training. The proposed architecture can be directly plugged into Stable Diffusion as well as modern flow-based text-to-image models, where it demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights based on the CLIP embedding, enabling more context-aware, scalable unlearning.

This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents.

We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage). Given a target risk and a validation set, we use distribution-free risk control to optimally specify these stopping mechanisms. For scenarios with multiple budget controlling criteria, we incorporate an efficiency loss to select the most computationally efficient exiting mechanism.

By coupling parallel multi-scale processing with linear-time sequence modeling, MARBLE provides a scalable and modular alternative to attention-based architectures. Experiments on five public datasets show improvements of up to \\textbf{6.9\\%} in AUC, \\textbf{20.3\\%} in accuracy, and \\textbf{2.3\\%} in C-index, establishing MARBLE as an efficient and generalizable framework for multi-scale WSI analysis."}

However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples. Experiments on the COCO and nuScenes benchmarks show consistent reductions in quantization error for camera-based (2D and 3D) and LiDAR-based (3D) object detection."}

Motivated by these findings, we propose $\\text{Nüwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors. In the second stage, within the LLM, we perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\\text{Nüwa}$ achieves SOTA performance on multiple VQA benchmarks (from 94% to 95%) and yields substantial improvements on visual grounding tasks (from 7% to 47%)."}

Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains.

We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding. Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior. Experiments show that hierarchical cross-domain alignment enables fine-grained, visually grounded image-text representations to emerge without explicit region-level supervision."}

Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text-image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train-inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning."}

The system selects the minimum-cost fidelity maximizing expected utility given predicted accuracy and retrieval costs. We evaluate VOILA across three deployment scenarios using five datasets (VQA-v2, GQA, TextVQA, LoCoMo, FloodNet) and six Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with 7B-235B parameters. VOILA consistently achieves 50-60% cost reductions while retaining 90-95% of full-resolution accuracy across diverse query types and model architectures, demonstrating that pre-retrieval fidelity selection is vital to optimize multimodal inference under resource constraints."}

To tackle LAC, we propose LogiCls, a vision-language framework that decomposes complex logical constraints into a sequence of verifiable subqueries. We further present a data-centric instruction synthesis pipeline that generates chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision for these subqueries, coupling precise grounding annotations with diverse image-text augmentations to adapt vision language models (VLMs) to logic-sensitive reasoning.

While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation. A lightweight transformer bridges the feature space of large language models and the conditional space of 3D diffusion models, enabling effective cross-modal information exchange while preserving the priors learned by standalone models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D understanding and generation benchmarks, while also excelling in 3D editing tasks. These results highlight the potential of unified AR+diffusion models as a promising direction for building more general-purpose 3D intelligence."}

Hence, estimating 3D poses of all nearby humans, tracking their movements over time, and understanding their activities within social and environmental contexts are essential for many applications, such as autonomous driving, robot perception, robot navigation, and human-robot interaction. However, most existing 3D human pose estimation datasets primarily focus on single-person scenes or are collected in controlled laboratory environments, which restricts their relevance to real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce JRDB-Pose3D, which captures multi-human indoor and outdoor environments from a mobile robotic platform. JRDB-Pose3D provides rich 3D human pose annotations for such complex and dynamic scenes, including SMPL-based pose annotations with consistent body-shape parameters and track IDs for each individual over time. JRDB-Pose3D contains, on average, 5-10 human poses per frame, with some scenes featuring up to 35 individuals simultaneously. The proposed dataset presents unique challenges, including frequent occlusions, truncated bodies, and out-of-frame body parts, which closely reflect real-world environments. Moreover, JRDB-Pose3D inherits all available annotations from the JRDB dataset, such as 2D pose, information about social grouping, activities, and interactions, full-scene semantic masks with consistent human- and object-level tracking, and detailed annotations for each individual, such as age, gender, and race, making it a holistic dataset for a wide range of downstream perception and human-centric understanding tasks."}

In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDGS delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits, achieving over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

However, unlike traditional augmentations like cropping or rotation, these methods introduce substantial changes that enhance robustness but also risk degrading performance if the augmentations are poorly matched to the task. In this work, we present EvoAug, an automated augmentation learning pipeline, which leverages these generative models alongside an efficient evolutionary algorithm to learn optimal task-specific augmentations.

Recently, deep learning (DL) based segmentation models have shown the capacity to accomplish such a task. However, the training of the segmentation networks requires large amount of data with manual annotations, which is a major concern due to the data scarcity from clinic. Working with limited data is still common for researches on novel imaging modalities. To enhance the effectiveness of DL models trained with limited data, data augmentation (DA) is a crucial regularization technique. Traditional DA (TDA) strategies focus on basic intra-image operations, i.e. generating images with different orientations and intensity distributions. In contrast, the interimage and object-level DA operations are able to create new images from separate individuals. However, such DA strategies are not well explored on the task of multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we investigated four possible inter-image DA strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug and AnatoMix, on two organ segmentation datasets. The result shows that CutMix, CarveMix and AnatoMix can improve the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0 and 1.9, compared with the state-of-the-art nnUNet without DA strategies. These results can be further improved by adding TDA strategies. It is revealed in our experiments that Cut-Mix is a robust but simple DA strategy to drive up the segmentation performance for multi-organ segmentation, even when CutMix produces intuitively 'wrong' images. Our implementation is publicly available for future benchmarks."}

To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers. Experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior."}

This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks.

While global geometry effectively encodes which elements are present, it is often insensitive to how they are composed. We investigate this limitation by testing the ability of geometric metrics to predict compositional binding across 21 vision encoders. We find that standard geometry-based statistics exhibit near-zero correlation with compositional binding. In contrast, functional sensitivity, as measured by the input-output Jacobian, reliably tracks this capability. We further provide an analytic account showing that this disparity arises from objective design, as existing losses explicitly constrain embedding geometry but leave the local input-output mapping unconstrained. These results suggest that global embedding geometry captures only a partial view of representational competence and establish functional sensitivity as a critical complementary axis for modeling composite structure."}

In human-machine comparisons, FOCUS matched expert performance in abnormality detection (F1: 95.47% vs 90.91%) and multi-disease diagnosis (F1: 93.49% vs 91.35%), while demonstrating better efficiency. FOCUS automates the image-to-diagnosis pipeline, representing a critical advance towards unmanned ophthalmology with a validated blueprint for autonomous screening to enhance population scale retinal care accessibility and efficiency."}

When target-domain normal data are unavailable, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) leverages vision-language models (VLMs). However, CLIP's coarse image-text alignment limits both localization and detection due to (i) spatial misalignment and (ii) weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies; prior work compensates with complex auxiliary modules yet largely overlooks the choice of backbone. We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture.

Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency.

However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks.

At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues. At the appearance level, we integrate the VLM-derived correspondences into a correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT).

Computer graphics engines can generate synthetic images alongside their ground-truth annotations. However, models trained on such images can perform poorly on real images due to the domain gap between real and synthetic images. Style transfer methods can reduce this difference by applying a realistic style to synthetic images. Choosing effective data transformations and their sequence is difficult due to the large combinatorial search space of style transfer operators. Using multi-objective genetic algorithms, we optimize pipelines to balance structural coherence and style similarity to target domains. We study the use of paired-image metrics on individual image samples during evolution to enable rapid pipeline evaluation, as opposed to standard distributional metrics that require the generation of many images. After optimization, we evaluate the resulting Pareto front using distributional metrics and segmentation performance. We apply this approach to standard datasets in synthetic-to-real domain adaptation: from the video game GTA5 to real image datasets Cityscapes and ACDC, focusing on adverse conditions. Results demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can propose diverse augmentation pipelines adapted to different objectives. The contribution of this work is the formulation of style transfer as a sequencing problem suitable for evolutionary optimization and the study of efficient metrics that enable feasible search in this space.

To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions.

Unfortunately, the radiographs collected during field campaigns are heterogeneous: bones are disarticulated, positioning is ad hoc, and laterality markers are often absent. Additionally, factors such as age at death, age of bone, sex, and imaging equipment introduce high variability. Thus, content navigation, such as identifying a subset of images with a specific projection view, can be time consuming and difficult, making efficient triaging a bottleneck for expert analysis. We report a zero shot prompting strategy that leverages a state of the art Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) to automatically identify the main bone, projection view, and laterality in such images. Our pipeline converts raw DICOM files to bone windowed PNGs, submits them to the LVLM with a carefully engineered prompt, and receives structured JSON outputs, which are extracted and formatted onto a spreadsheet in preparation for validation. On a random sample of 100 images reviewed by an expert board certified paleoradiologist, the system achieved 92% main bone accuracy, 80% projection view accuracy, and 100% laterality accuracy, with low or medium confidence flags for ambiguous cases.

RIAS generates precise masks from text descriptions without manual thresholds and uses universal prompts to detect diverse anomalies with a single model. We introduce the MVTec-Ref dataset to support this, designed with diverse referring expressions and focusing on anomaly patterns, notably with 95% small anomalies. We also propose the Dual Query Token with Mask Group Transformer (DQFormer) benchmark, enhanced by Language-Gated Multi-Level Aggregation (LMA) to improve multi-scale segmentation. Unlike traditional methods using redundant queries, DQFormer employs only \"Anomaly\" and \"Background\" tokens for efficient visual-textual integration.

To address this limitation, we introduce a new multi-round visual reasoning benchmark with training and test sets spanning both detection and segmentation tasks, enabling systematic evaluation under iterative reasoning scenarios. We further propose RegionReasoner, a reinforcement learning framework that enforces grounded reasoning by requiring each reasoning trace to explicitly cite the corresponding reference bounding boxes, while maintaining semantic coherence via a global-local consistency reward. This reward extracts key objects and nouns from both global scene captions and region-level captions, aligning them with the reasoning trace to ensure consistency across reasoning steps. RegionReasoner is optimized with structured rewards combining grounding fidelity and global-local semantic alignment.

Although robotic platforms equipped with visual sensors can efficiently detect structural deficiencies, the automated generation of human-readable summaries from these detections remains a significant challenge, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline for end-to-end summarization of underground deficiencies, combining our lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployed on an edge computing platform. The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. We deploy and evaluate our complete pipeline on a mobile robotic platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world inspection scenarios. Our results show the potential of edge-deployable integrated AI systems to bridge the gap between automated defect detection and actionable insights for infrastructure maintenance, paving the way for more scalable and autonomous inspection solutions."}

While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation. Moreover, we provide an unified view that encompasses different approaches and introduce progressive training curriculum to stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate that LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths."}

To address the scarcity of training data, we introduce a scalable engine that bootstraps high-quality supervision from commercial Live2D models, capturing pixel-perfect semantics and hidden geometry. Our methodology couples a diffusion-based Body Part Consistency Module, which enforces global geometric coherence, with a pixel-level pseudo-depth inference mechanism. This combination resolves the intricate stratification of anime characters, e.g., interleaving hair strands, allowing for dynamic layer reconstruction.

Unfortunately, the radiographs collected during field campaigns are heterogeneous: bones are disarticulated, positioning is ad hoc, and laterality markers are often absent. Additionally, factors such as age at death, age of bone, sex, and imaging equipment introduce high variability. Thus, content navigation, such as identifying a subset of images with a specific projection view, can be time consuming and difficult, making efficient triaging a bottleneck for expert analysis. We report a zero shot prompting strategy that leverages a state of the art Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) to automatically identify the main bone, projection view, and laterality in such images. Our pipeline converts raw DICOM files to bone windowed PNGs, submits them to the LVLM with a carefully engineered prompt, and receives structured JSON outputs, which are extracted and formatted onto a spreadsheet in preparation for validation. On a random sample of 100 images reviewed by an expert board certified paleoradiologist, the system achieved 92% main bone accuracy, 80% projection view accuracy, and 100% laterality accuracy, with low or medium confidence flags for ambiguous cases. These results suggest that LVLMs can substantially accelerate code word development for large paleoradiology datasets, allowing for efficient content navigation in future anthropology workflows."}

By optimizing a similarity objective (the potential) at inference, we steer the denoising process toward a conditioned representation extracted from a pre-trained feature extractor. Our method provides versatile control at multiple scales, ranging from fine-grained texture matching via single patches to broad semantic guidance using global image feature tokens. We further extend this to multi-concept composition, allowing for the faithful combination of distinct concepts. REPA-G operates entirely at inference time, offering a flexible and precise alternative to often ambiguous text prompts or coarse class labels.

We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision.

Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware. Code will be released."}

However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients.

However, 2D poses rigidly bind motion to the driving viewpoint, precluding novel-view synthesis. Explicit 3D models, though structurally informative, suffer from inherent inaccuracies (e.g., depth ambiguity and inaccurate dynamics) which, when used as a strong constraint, override the powerful intrinsic 3D awareness of large-scale video generators. In this work, we revisit motion control from a 3D-aware perspective, advocating for an implicit, view-agnostic motion representation that naturally aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on externally reconstructed constraints. We introduce 3DiMo, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens, injected semantically via cross-attention. To foster 3D awareness, we train with view-rich supervision (i.e., single-view, multi-view, and moving-camera videos), forcing motion consistency across diverse viewpoints. Additionally, we use auxiliary geometric supervision that leverages SMPL only for early initialization and is annealed to zero, enabling the model to transition from external 3D guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding from the data and the generator's priors. Experiments confirm that 3DiMo faithfully reproduces driving motions with flexible, text-driven camera control, significantly surpassing existing methods in both motion fidelity and visual quality."}

Some recent works have addressed this by conditioning between scales in a multiscale pyramid. Others have looked at parallelizing samples in a single image using regular partitions or randomized orders. In this work we examine a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. Our ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step. This enables effective conditioning both between and within scales. Intriguingly, we find evidence that in our balanced setting, a wide range of scale-up factors lead to similar results, so long as the total number of serial steps is constant. On class-conditional ImageNet, our method achieves competitive performance compared to recent state-of-the-art autoregressive systems with like model capacity, using fewer sampling steps."}

Inspired by the success of Visual Token Pruning (VTP) in improving inference efficiency, we are exploring another substantial research direction for efficient training by reducing visual tokens. However, applying VTP at the training stage results in a training-inference mismatch: pruning-trained models perform poorly when inferring on non-pruned full visual token sequences. To close this gap, we propose DualSpeed, a fast-slow framework for efficient training of MLLMs. The fast-mode is the primary mode, which incorporates existing VTP methods as plugins to reduce visual tokens, along with a mode isolator to isolate the model's behaviors. The slow-mode is the auxiliary mode, where the model is trained on full visual sequences to retain training-inference consistency. To boost its training, it further leverages self-distillation to learn from the sufficiently trained fast-mode. Together, DualSpeed can achieve both training efficiency and non-degraded performance.

However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets."}

A core difficulty is that existing agents lack a mechanism to learn fine-grained, tool-level expertise from interaction. Without such expertise, they cannot reliably configure tool parameters or recover from mid-execution failures, limiting their effectiveness in complex EO workflows. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{GeoEvolver}, a self-evolving multi-agent system~(MAS) that enables LLM agents to acquire EO expertise through structured interaction without any parameter updates. GeoEvolver decomposes each query into independent sub-goals via a retrieval-augmented multi-agent orchestrator, then explores diverse tool-parameter configurations at the sub-goal level. Successful patterns and root-cause attribution from failures are then distilled in an evolving memory bank that provides in-context demonstrations for future queries.
