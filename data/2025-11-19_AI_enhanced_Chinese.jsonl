However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u5927\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6 SpatiaLite \u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bc4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f4e\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5176\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5f15\u5165 SpatiaLite \u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5 VLMs \u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5f00\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa Imagery Driven Framework \u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5148\u8fdb VLMs \u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff1bIDF \u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u9690\u5f0f\u6784\u5efa\u5185\u90e8\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "VLMs \u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e09\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684 Imagery Driven Framework \u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \\textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies.

However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u6270\u52a8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u672a\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u672a\u77e5\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6837\u672c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6a21\u7cca\u5df2\u77e5\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u663e\u5f0f\u7f13\u89e3\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u53e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\u7684OSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u5df2\u77e5\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728OSR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u53e0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5df2\u77e5\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3aOSR\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $\u03b2$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCORGI\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u8fed\u4ee3\u66ff\u4ee3RETE\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5339\u914d\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RETE\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u5728\u4e25\u82db\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u89c4\u5219\u542b\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u751a\u81f3\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5728\u7ebfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u574f\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u6267\u884c\u505c\u6ede\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aCORGI\uff08\u9762\u5411\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u524d\u5411\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u7ef4\u62a4\u5df2\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u56fe\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5668\u9006\u5411\u904d\u5386\u751f\u6210\u6240\u9700\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4e0d\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u51b2\u7a81\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u5355\u4e2a\u6ee1\u610f\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u4e3a\u5e73\u65b9\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6309\u9700\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u540e\u7eed\u5339\u914d\u3002\u4e0eRETE\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cCORGI\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u03b2\u5185\u5b58\u6765\u6536\u96c6\u90e8\u5206\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCORGI\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eSOAR\u548cOPS5\u4e2d\u7684RETE\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "CORGI\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e73\u65b9\u7ea7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c4\u5219\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86RETE\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u89c4\u5219\u751f\u6210\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals.

However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u4e8b\u6545\u62a5\u544a\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u5371\u9669\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408VQA\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8b\u6545\u7684\u5371\u9669\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u6781\u4e3a\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5386\u53f2\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8fd8\u539f\u7684\u5371\u9669\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u5371\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u804c\u4e1a\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40\uff08OSHA\uff09\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u62a5\u544a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u5371\u9669\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5371\u9669\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff08VQA\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684VQA\u56fe\u8bc4\u5206\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eCLIP\u548cBLIP\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u71b5\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5224\u522b\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5371\u9669\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u5371\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design.

We synthesize the historical evolution from rule-based models to contemporary approaches involving deep learning, multi-agent architectures, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks. The pedagogical implications are evaluated through a dual-case methodology: (1) the use of generative AI platforms in secondary education to foster analytical and creative skills; (2) the design of a multiagent system for symbolic music analysis, enabling modular, scalable, and explainable workflows.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that AI agents effectively enhance musical pattern recognition, compositional parameterization, and educational feedback, outperforming traditional automated methods in terms of interpretability and adaptability. The findings highlight key challenges concerning transparency, cultural bias, and the definition of hybrid evaluation metrics, emphasizing the need for responsible deployment of AI in educational environments.\n  This research contributes to a unified framework that bridges technical, pedagogical, and ethical considerations, offering evidence-based guidance for the design and application of intelligent agents in computational musicology and music education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53cc\u6848\u4f8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u5728\u5206\u6790\u3001\u521b\u4f5c\u53ca\u6559\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8b66\u793a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u6587\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u53ca\u4f26\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u68b3\u7406\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u53d8\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u662f\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e73\u53f0\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u521b\u9020\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u7b26\u53f7\u97f3\u4e50\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53ca\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u97f3\u4e50\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u4f5c\u66f2\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53ca\u6559\u80b2\u53cd\u9988\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u6587\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u4e0e\u4f26\u7406\u8003\u91cf\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u97f3\u4e50\u5b66\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u6559\u80b2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5faa\u8bc1\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u65e0\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e8b\u6545\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528 Mapfusion \u751f\u6210\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\u5e76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u76d1\u6d4b\u6bd4\u5bf9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u8f66\u8f86\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u65e0\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b Mapfusion\uff0c\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\u9010\u6b65\u52a0\u566a\u81f3\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u5d4c\u5165\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528 ControlNet \u878d\u5408\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76d1\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e8b\u6545\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "Mapfusion \u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8def\u6bb5\u53d8\u5316\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u95f4\u9694\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65e0\u8f68\u8ff9\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u53d6\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u8def\u6bb5\u6f14\u5316\u5730\u56fe\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC).

However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faADATG\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u4e0eHilbert\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5728\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u6355\u6349\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u5730\u9707\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eHilbert\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cc\u7f51\u683c\uff08ADATG\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u9891\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42Hilbert\u7f16\u7801\u8868\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5148\u5173\u6ce8\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u518d\u9010\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u5730\u9707\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5730\u9707\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faSyn-STARTS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u5206\u8bca\u6848\u4f8b\u89e3\u51b3MCI\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76f8\u5f53\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u533b\u7597AI\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f24\u4ea1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08MCI\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8bca\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4f24\u8005\u751f\u5b58\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4e8b\u6545\u53d1\u751f\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u73b0\u573a\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6536\u96c6\u8db3\u591f\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8eAI\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSyn-STARTS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5206\u8bca\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6574\u7406\u7684TRIAGE\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f9d\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u8bca\u65b9\u6cd5START\u7684\u7eff\u3001\u9ec4\u3001\u7ea2\u3001\u9ed1\u56db\u7c7b\u6848\u4f8b\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "Syn-STARTS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u8bca\u6848\u4f8b\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6574\u7406\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u5206\u8bca\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e25\u5cfb\u548c\u5371\u91cd\u533b\u7597\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdAI\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u65e9\u671f\u75f4\u5446\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u5efa\u7684YT DemTalk\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u51dd\u89c6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u53e3/\u4e0b\u988c\u52a8\u6001\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7b5b\u67e5\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u75f4\u5446\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u975e\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u8f6c\u5f55\u8d28\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u7ec6\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u8bed\u8a00\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba4\u77e5\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u7a97\u53e3\u5316\u5c06\u5fae\u52a8\u4f5c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u5404\u8fd0\u52a8\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u6d45\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684YT DemTalk\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b150\u4e2a\u81ea\u62a5\u544a\u75f4\u5446\u548c150\u4e2a\u5bf9\u7167\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728YT DemTalk\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u51dd\u89c6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u53e3/\u4e0b\u988c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u6d45\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u75f4\u5446\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97AUROC 0.953\u3001AP 0.961\u3001F1-score 0.851\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u73870.857\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\uff08\u5982\u7728\u773c\u3001\u53e3/\u4e0b\u988c\u5fae\u52a8\u3001\u51dd\u89c6\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u7ec6\u5fae\u5934\u90e8\u8c03\u6574\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u8bed\u97f3\u6216\u6587\u672c\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u75f4\u5446\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u8de8\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u63a8\u5e7f\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark", "comment": "10 pages", "summary": "While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGen-ViRe\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u5e27\u63a8\u7406\uff08CoF\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u591a\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u903b\u8f91\u6216\u62bd\u8c61\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGen-ViRe\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c06CoF\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u516d\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u5212\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u534f\u8bae\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df7\u5408VLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u53ca\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "Gen-ViRe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u5ba1\u6838\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u5206\u914d\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d2a\u5fc3\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8bfe\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u6210\u5168\u6280\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bca\u65ad\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u5305\u62ec\u6280\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u533a\u95f4\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u3001\u5148\u4fee\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u6982\u5ff5\u77e9\u9635\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u6027\u907f\u514d\u5197\u4f59\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u8d2a\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u8d44\u6e90\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8981\u6c42\u7d27\uff09\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\uff08\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ecb\u4e8e\u4e24\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Slack\u53d8\u91cf\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f3a\u5931\u5185\u5bb9\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5bf91204\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8bfe\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5747\u80fd\u5728\u9650\u5b9a\u89c2\u770b\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u57fa\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u6280\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u3002\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5fc3\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8986\u76d6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u7ea612\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u8d2a\u5fc3\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6027\u3002Slack\u53d8\u91cf\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u751f\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5145\u8db3\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u914d\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u95ed\u5408\u8bca\u65ad-\u6559\u5b66\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5728\u73ed\u7ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u8d1f\u8f7d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u5b66\u3002"}}

Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance.

Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources.

Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout.

However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network.

Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark.

Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\\% (single run) to 25\\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \\textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance.

The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet.

However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability.

We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance.

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding.

DeSouza"], "title": "Weakly Supervised Ephemeral Gully Detection In Remote Sensing Images Using Vision Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations.

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u533a\u57dfAirbnb\u6307\u6807\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u9996\u5c14\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea648%\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u4f4f\u623f\u653f\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u77ed\u79df\u5e73\u53f0\u5982Airbnb\u7684\u6269\u5f20\u5bf9\u5f53\u5730\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\u9020\u6210\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u79df\u91d1\u4e0a\u6da8\u4e0e\u4f4f\u623f\u53ef\u8d1f\u62c5\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u533a\u57df\u5e02\u573a\u8d8b\u52bf\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u8f85\u52a9\u5236\u5b9a\u7f13\u89e3\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u67651\u81f33\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u6536\u5165\u3001\u9884\u8ba2\u5929\u6570\u4e0e\u9884\u8ba2\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u623f\u6e90\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u8bed\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u57ce\u5e02\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u6d41\u52a8\uff09\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u518d\u8f93\u5165RNN\u3001LSTM\u3001Transformer\u7b49\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9996\u5c14Airbnb\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747RMSE\u548cMAE\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea648%\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u4f9b\u5e94\u8fc7\u5269\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u623f\u6e90\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u77ed\u79df\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8d8b\u52bf\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u653f\u7b56\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "PathMind\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u5165\u7cbe\u7b80\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u63a2\u7d22\u8def\u5f84\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u8c03\u7528LLM\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPathMind\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u68c0\u7d22-\u4f18\u5148-\u63a8\u7406\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u68c0\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u5b50\u56fe\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5148\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u5df2\u7d2f\u8ba1\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u6210\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u7b5b\u9009\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPathMind\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8f93\u5165token\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "PathMind\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u5173\u6ce8\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation.

To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements.

However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO.

This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization.

Procedural Warm-Up for Vision Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data.

Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria.

Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports.

Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., \"lift hands more to generate more power\" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art.

While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.\n  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.\n  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.", "AI": {"tldr": "RISE\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5f84\u53cd\u5c04\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u9759\u6001\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5ba4\u5185\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u65e2\u8981\u9c81\u68d2\u53c8\u8981\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u867d\u7136\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u906e\u6321\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u53ef\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u7a7f\u900f\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u591a\u5f84\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5f25\u8865\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u5355\u9759\u6001\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edfRISE\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u53cc\u89d2\u5ea6\u591a\u5f84\u589e\u5f3a(Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement)\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5230\u8fbe\u89d2\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u89d2\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5f84\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u606f\u6062\u590d\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6(Hierarchical Diffusion)\u5c06\u96f7\u8fbe\u788e\u7247\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b5\u4e07\u5e27\u3001100\u6761\u771f\u5b9e\u5ba4\u5185\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efaChamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e60%\u81f316cm\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cIoU\u8fbe\u523058%\u3002", "conclusion": "RISE\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u91cd\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention.

Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions.

The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability.

However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost.

Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance.

This dependency on \"big data\" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.\n  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset.

This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured \"Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train\" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDEER-3D\u9519\u8bef\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7f16\u8f913D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u53473D-LLM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u51c6\u786e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u504f\u91cd\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5145\u8db3\u76843D\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u504f\u5dee\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u5b9a\u4f4d\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a213D\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51faDEER-3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u201c\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u201d\u56db\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u8c13\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u76d1\u7763\u6837\u672c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a3D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7f16\u8f91\u6d41\u7a0b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u53d6\u5f97\u7a33\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u9a71\u52a8\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53473D\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u3002"}}

The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBCE3S\u4e09\u65b9\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5934\u5c3e\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7c7b\u5185\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u95f4\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u4e14\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u7684\u4e09\u65b9\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08BCE3S\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09BCE\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591aSigmoid\u89e3\u8026\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f81\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff1b2\uff09BCE\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7c7b\u5185\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\uff1b3\uff09BCE\u5747\u5300\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4ea4\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR10-LT\u3001CIFAR100-LT\u3001ImageNet-LT\u3001iNaturalist2018\u7b49\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "BCE3S\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration.

While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing.

Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u884c\u4eba-\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u6545\u5206\u6790\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6MP-PVIR\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u56e0\u679c\u94fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u4e8b\u6545\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e8b\u6545\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9884\u9632\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6574\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u91c7\u96c6\u3001\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9636\u6bb5\u5185\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5c42\u7ea7\u7efc\u5408\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u5229\u7528TG-VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\uff08mIoU=0.4881\uff09\uff0cPhaVR-VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5b57\u5e55\u5f97\u520633.063\uff0c\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6700\u9ad864.70%\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5168\u9762\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Woven Traffic Safety\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u6790\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u89e3\u8bfb\u53ca\u9884\u9632\u5efa\u8bae\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347AI\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "MP-PVIR\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u9884\u9632\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8f66\u8def\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset.

State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faA\u00b2GC-VPR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u6e90\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfSinkhorn\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u79f0\u5904\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u5339\u914d\u6548\u679c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u805a\u5408\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5A\u00b2GC-VPR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u5217\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5e73\u5747\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u8fb9\u9645\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5750\u6807\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u517c\u5bb9\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u5230\u540c\u4e00\u7c07\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728MSLS\u3001NordLand\u548cPittsburgh\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "A\u00b2GC-VPR\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5339\u914d\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u548c\u9700\u8981\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance.

However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions.

We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faConvNN\u6846\u67b6\u7edf\u4e00\u5377\u79ef\u4e0e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4f5c\u6839\u672c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u90bb\u5c45\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u805a\u5408\u4e0a\u6709\u5171\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u7edf\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u6709\u671b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5377\u79ef\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\uff08ConvNN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5k\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u6709\u5377\u79ef\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\u5377\u79ef\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\uff08ConvNN\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89c6\u4f5c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u805a\u5408\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u7279\u4f8b\uff1a\u5377\u79ef\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u90bb\u5c45\uff0c\u800c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u90bb\u5c45\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u4e8c\u8005\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u4e0a\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u5377\u79ef\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63a2\u7d22\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cCIFAR-100\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5728VGG\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ViT\u4e2d\u7528ConvNN\u53d6\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u8c31\u4e0a\u63d2\u503c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u5e26\u6765\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5377\u79ef\u4e0e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u5728\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u805a\u5408\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u8c31\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002"}}

Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training.

This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics.

In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWave-Former\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u906e\u6321\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea63D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce23D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u6280\u672f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u906e\u6321\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u9762\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u4e3a\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684Transformer\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8868\u9762\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Wave-Former\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea63D\u5f62\u72b6\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u88ab\u5b8c\u5168\u906e\u6321\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u6280\u672f\u5229\u7528\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7f\u900f\u969c\u788d\u5e76\u53cd\u5c04\u9690\u85cf\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9ad8\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002Wave-Former\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863D\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5176\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5305\u62ec\u5019\u9009\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u9762\u751f\u6210\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7684Transformer\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8868\u9762\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u5408\u6210\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5728\u4e0e\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ece54%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523072%\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u4fdd\u6301\u572885%\u3002", "conclusion": "Wave-Former\u5728\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space.

Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u53cc\u76ee\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7eb9\u7406\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8ba9\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8d34\u7247\u653b\u51fb\u5e76\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u53cc\u76ee\u7acb\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u4f2a\u88c5\u7eb9\u7406\u800c\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8d34\u7247\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53cc\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u53cc\u76ee\u5339\u914d\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7fPAE\u5728\u53cc\u76ee\u89c6\u91ce\u4e0b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u878d\u5408\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316PAE\u4f18\u5316\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u65e0\u7f1d\u878d\u5165\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cc\u76ee\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u8bf1\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u85cf\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9996\u6b21\u9488\u5bf9\u53cc\u76ee\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7eb9\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u81f4\u547d\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u524a\u5f31\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53cc\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "AVI\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u957f\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u9002\u7528\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u6269\u5c55\u7684Agentic Video Intelligence\uff08AVI\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u9879\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u68c0\u7d22-\u611f\u77e5-\u56de\u987e\uff09\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5168\u5c40\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u5206\u6790\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f53\u56fe\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u53ca\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u4f5c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406LLM\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u53caVLM\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u6709API\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728LVBench\u3001VideoMME-Long\u3001LongVideoBench\u548cCharades-STA\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AVI\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training.

The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faUniSER\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7380\u4e07\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548cDiffusion Transformer\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u8f6f\u6027\u9000\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u9000\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u70ab\u5149\u3001\u96fe\u973e\u3001\u9634\u5f71\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u8f6f\u6027\u9000\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u901a\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5404\u79cd\u8f6f\u6027\u9000\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b380\u4e07\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u586b\u8865\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u7a7a\u7f3a\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bf9Diffusion Transformer\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u5728\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684UniSER\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7531\u8f6f\u6027\u9000\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u52a3\u5316\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e13\u7528\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "UniSER\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5b9a\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u8f6f\u6027\u9000\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "GloTok\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u5728ImageNet-1k\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5c40\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u5df2\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u7403\u89c6\u89d2\u6807\u8bb0\u5668\uff08GloTok\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6574\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\uff1b\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u91cf\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "GloTok\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728ImageNet-1k\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames.

Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications.

Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures.

Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "InstantViR\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u8d28\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5b9e\u65f6\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\u8868\u73b0\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u9ad8\u753b\u8d28\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u5165\u4e34\u65f6\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u800c\u539f\u751f\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u592a\u6162\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInstantViR\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u53cc\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u76f4\u63a5\u6062\u590d\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5df2\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5e72\u51c0/\u566a\u58f0\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u9aa8\u5e72\u7684VAE\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548LeanVAE\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u968f\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u4fee\u590d\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cInstantViR\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728NVIDIA A100 GPU\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523035\u5e27\u6bcf\u79d2\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5feb\u6700\u591a100\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f7f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u4fee\u590d\u6210\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition.

However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "WeSTAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7fMDE\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u7c7bOOD\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MDE\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u91cd\u5927\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u90e8\u5206\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u8fd8\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWeSTAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9MDE\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5bc6\u96c6\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6210\u5bf9\u5e8f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u5c40\u90e8\u62d3\u6251\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u56fa\u5b9aLoRA\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u53d7\u6270\u52a8\u7684OOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aWeSTAR\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5bc6\u96c6\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u5f31\u5e8f\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0cWeSTAR\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86MDE\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u548c\u591a\u6837\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task.

Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection.

However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model.

First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors.

During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth).

However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6e90\u9759\u6001CT\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Diff-NAF\u8fed\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u51cf\u573a\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u6837\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4CT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u8d28\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b64\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u7528\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6295\u5f71\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u51cf\u573a\uff08NAF\uff09\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u89d2\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u6295\u5f71\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u7cbe\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6295\u5f71\uff1b\u7cbe\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u52a0\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df3D CT\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6295\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cDiff-NAF\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDiff-NAF\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684CT\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases.

However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ArchMap\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u7259\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76843D\u53e3\u5185\u626b\u63cf\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f3a\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7259\u79d13D\u626b\u63cf\u89e3\u6790\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u626b\u63cf\u6761\u4ef6\u8981\u6c42\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u53e3\u51853D\u7f51\u683c\u5b58\u5728\u5f13\u5f62\u59ff\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7f3a\u5931\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArchMap\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f13\u5f62\u5c55\u5f00\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u539f\u59cb3D\u7f51\u683c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u518d\u6784\u5efa\u7259\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff08DKB\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7259\u9f7f\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u3001\u7259\u5217\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u57281060\u4f8b\u6b63\u7578\u524d\u540e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cArchMap\u5728\u7259\u9f7f\u8ba1\u6570\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u533a\u3001\u7259\u5217\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee5\u53ca\u62e5\u6324\u3001\u7f3a\u7259\u3001\u5047\u7259\u3001\u9f8b\u9f7f\u7b49\u4e34\u5e8a\u60c5\u51b5\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u66f4\u5c11\u3001\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u6709\u4f2a\u5f71\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "ArchMap\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0e\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u5b57\u6b63\u7578\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u53e3\u5185\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u5256\u5750\u6807\u548c\u53cc\u5411Chamfer\u4f18\u5316\u7684DentalSCR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0IOS\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5934\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u7247\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u914d\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u914d\u51c6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53d7\u6295\u5f71\u653e\u5927\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7578\u53d8\u3001\u7259\u51a0\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u53ca\u91c7\u96c6\u5dee\u5f02\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u6536\u655b\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8f6e\u5ed3\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDentalSCR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5750\u6807\u7cfbUMDA\u7a33\u5b9a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0e\u6295\u5f71\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u7684DRR\u6295\u5f71\uff08\u51a0\u72b6\u8f74\u900f\u89c6+\u9ad8\u65af\u55b7\u6e85\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u4f3cX\u5149\u7247\u7684\u5916\u8f6e\u5ed3\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u5411Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b02D\u76f8\u4f3c\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u572834\u4f8b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cDentalSCR\u5728\u540e\u7259\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e0b\u988c\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\uff0c\u66f2\u7ebf\u7ea7Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f4e\u4e14Hausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d7\u63a7\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DentalSCR\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5934\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u7247\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u6210\u50cf\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u53ef\u4e34\u5e8a\u68c0\u89c6\u76843D-2D\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6b63\u7578\u8bca\u65ad\u4e14\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects.

The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples.

Project website: https://bedlam2.is.tue.mpg.de", "summary": "Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates.

Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating \"knowledge islands\" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts.

In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset).

To explore the ecological advantages of such staged \"visual diets\", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines.

The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\\textbf{25.5}$ and $\\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\uff0cSEED-SR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u519c\u7530\u8fb9\u754c\u5212\u5206\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u519c\u7530\u8fb9\u754c\u5212\u5206\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u56e0\u91cd\u8bbf\u5468\u671f\u957f\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u9891\u76d1\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5f71\u50cf\u867d\u53ef\u9ad8\u9891\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u5374\u5ffd\u7565\u5206\u5272\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u6b65\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u591a\u6e90\u3001\u591a\u8c31\u6bb5\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u5272\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u519c\u7530\u8fb9\u754c\u5212\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u3001\u591a\u8c31\u6bb5\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u572820\u500d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5272\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SEED-SR\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u519c\u7530\u8fb9\u754c\u5212\u5206\u4e2d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\u5927\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f4e\u53ca\u591a\u6e90\u878d\u5408\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions.

However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u539f\u7406\u7684\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5D-PerceptCT\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4e34\u5e8a\u5173\u952e\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8f90\u5c04\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u8bca\u65ad\u5173\u952e\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\u7ec4\u6210\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668ViDex\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DINOv2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u3001\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5757\uff08\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570DPRLF\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u8981\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728Mayo2016\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cD-PerceptCT\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524dSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "D-PerceptCT\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u6709\u8bca\u65ad\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction.

An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs.

We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u60013D\u9ad8\u65af\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u624b-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u878d\u5408\u624b\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65e0\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4e92\u76f8\u906e\u6321\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u7cca\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd0\u52a8\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u60013D\u9ad8\u65afSplatting\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u578b\u624b-\u7269\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0e\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u624b\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u573a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u65e0\u4efb\u4f55\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u624b-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4e09\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af splatting \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u76f8\u906e\u6321\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u578b\u624b-\u7269\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u624b\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u7eb3\u5165\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u573a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u7075\u6d3b\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u57df\u518d\u5904\u7406\u9759\u6001\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc7\u6e21\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u53ca\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u60013D-GS\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u65b0\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u60013D-GS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002"}}

Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus.

Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOmniZip\u97f3\u9891\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u8054\u5408\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.42X\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c1.4X\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5904\u7406\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u672a\u9488\u5bf9\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u8054\u5408\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniZip\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u97f3\u9891\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u8054\u5408\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u97f3\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u7ec4\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u4fdd\u7559\u5206\u6570\u6355\u6349\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\u526a\u679d\uff1b\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u65b9\u6848\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "OmniZip\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u635f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u5176\u4ed6\u9876\u5c16\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863.42\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u548c1.4\u500d\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniZip\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines.

Project page: https://miya-oi.github.io/SparseSurf-project", "summary": "Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \\net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\\net{}\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55-\u7eb9\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4f2a\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f18\u5316Gaussian Splatting\u5728\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u56fe\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e14\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\\net{}\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment\u5c06\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency\u5229\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u7a00\u758f\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728DTU\u3001BlendedMVS\u548cMip-NeRF360\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\\net{}\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks.
