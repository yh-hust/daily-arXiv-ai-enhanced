Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-\u03b1 constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u6784\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7ed3\u5408PJAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21JRA\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u4e3a0.00%\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3TSP\u7b49\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8def\u7531-\u5206\u914d\uff08JRA\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u53ef\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff08MIP\uff09\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u6784\uff08PPR\uff09\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7269\u54c1-\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\u5bf9\u5f62\u6210\u89c4\u6a21\u7f29\u51cf\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408PJAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u5584\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u8c03\u7528PPR\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u5c40Large-\u03b1\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08n = 300, 500, 1000\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u8fbe0.00%\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u65c5\u884c\u5546\u95ee\u9898\uff08TSP\uff09\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PPR\u4e0ePJAR\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21JRA\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.\n  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out.

To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faRebellion\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08RT\uff09\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARMs\uff09\u9010\u6e10\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65e8\u5728\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u6807\u51c6RT\u7ed3\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u666e\u901a\u97f3\u9891\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51faRebellion\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen2-Audio\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRebellion\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u826f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u97f3\u9891\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Rebellion\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7fARMs\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions.

However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency.

We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human \"gold\" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication.

The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events.

Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model.

Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e26\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u7684 Social LSTM\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u62e5\u6324\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u884c\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u4ece\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u884c\u4eba\u89c6\u4e3a\u65e0\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u70b9\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5360\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u907f\u514d\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7248 Social LSTM\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08Dynamic Occupied Space\uff09\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u5360\u7528\u654f\u611f\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u60e9\u7f5a\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u907f\u514d\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ece 2022 \u5e74\u91cc\u6602\u706f\u5149\u8282\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u591a 31%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d 5% \u548c 6%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6570\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u884c\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u4f4e\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u548c\u8f83\u597d\u4f4d\u79fb\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments.

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5f71\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u7076\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4ecd\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08FMs\uff09\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\uff08\u533b\u5b66 vs. \u901a\u7528\uff09\u3001\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u67b6\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u96be\u4ee5\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u76848\u4e2aFM\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u80a5\u5927\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u5c55\u5b50\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u63a2\u8ba8\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6377\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u663e\u8457\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u7136\u800c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ec6\u5fae\u75c5\u7076\u7684\u5206\u5272\u5982\u6c14\u80f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0FMs\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u65f6\u4f1a\u5229\u7528\u5982\u80f8\u7ba1\u7b49\u6df7\u6dc6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5272\u65f6\u5931\u6548\u3002\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u987b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u56fe\u50cf\u4ec5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u9760\u524d\u3002\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u4f73FMs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u521d\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5982\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff09\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u975e\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u662f\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated.

However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training.

First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model. Extensive benchmark experiments show that AlphaDE remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods even with few-shot fine-tuning. An interesting case study further shows that AlphaDE supports condensing the protein sequence space through computational evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "AlphaDE \u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5b9a\u5411\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa AlphaDE \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u6e90\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u76ee\u6807\u86cb\u767d\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u8fdb\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cAlphaDE \u5728\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fdb\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "AlphaDE \u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPANDA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8865\u4e01\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u5e73\u8861\u6765\u7f13\u89e3EFCL\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u4fdd\u5b58\u65e7\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65e0\u6837\u672c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08EFCL\uff09\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u4e0b\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5373\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u6781\u5ea6\u503e\u659c\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPANDA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u8865\u4e01\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5229\u7528CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u627e\u51fa\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u9891\u7e41\u7c7b\u522b\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u7a00\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5e73\u6ed1\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "PANDA\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u7f1d\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51bb\u7ed3PTM\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u8865\u4e01\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\uff0cPANDA\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4e86EFCL\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models.

Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided. Preliminary results indicate the improvements with our AI assistant in document information extraction and question-answering tasks.

Animating Human Avatars in Diverse Scenes with Gaussian Splatting", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u75283D Gaussian Splatting\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e09\u7ef4\u4eba\u7269\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u5bf9\u9f50\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e92\u52a8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u753b\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u6216\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u5174\u76843D Gaussian Splatting\uff083DGS\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u75283DGS\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u52a0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u753b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee53DGS\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u76843D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7269\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5747\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u8026\u5904\u7406\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u65af\u5bf9\u9f50\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u53ca\u6295\u5f71\u9ad8\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\u4eba\u7269\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Scannet++\u548cSuperSplat\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u4e0e\u7a20\u5bc6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6355\u83b7\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u76eeRGB\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u66ff\u6362\u5e76\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u65b0\u4eba\u7269\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4eba\u7269-\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e863DGS\u5728\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5e76\u62d3\u5c55\u4e863DGS\u5728\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u753b\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Version with Appendix", "summary": "We introduce SPAN, a cross-calendar temporal reasoning benchmark, which requires LLMs to perform intra-calendar temporal reasoning and inter-calendar temporal conversion. SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning.

In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification.

ChEmREF is organized into three tasks: (1) translation of chemical representation between structured and unstructured forms (e.g., converting C2H6O to ethanol), (2) emergency response generation (e.g., recommending appropriate evacuation distances) and (3) domain knowledge question answering from chemical safety and certification exams. Our best evaluated models received an exact match of 68.0% on unstructured HAZMAT chemical representation translation, a LLM Judge score of 52.7% on incident response recommendations, and a multiple-choice accuracy of 63.9% on HAMZAT examinations.These findings suggest that while language models show potential to assist emergency responders in various tasks, they require careful human oversight due to their current limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faChEmREF\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5efa\u8bae\u751f\u6210\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e94\u6025\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5371\u9669\u54c1\uff08HAZMAT\uff09\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7d27\u8feb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ece\u7e41\u6742\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\u6307\u5f15\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u627e\u5230\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u505a\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u5f53\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u4eec\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5371\u5bb3\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff08ChEmREF\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7531\u6765\u81ea\u300a\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u6307\u5357\u300b\u548cPubChem\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u76841035\u79cdHAZMAT\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\u95ee\u9898\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5316\u5b66\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e92\u8bd1\uff08\u5982\u5c06C2H6O\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e59\u9187\uff09\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\uff08\u5982\u63a8\u8350\u64a4\u79bb\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5316\u5b66\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8003\u8bd5\u7684\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u6025\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u8868\u793a\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u7387\u4e3a68.0%\uff0c\u5728\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u4e2dLLM Judge\u8bc4\u5206\u4e3a52.7%\uff0c\u5728HAZMAT\u8003\u8bd5\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a63.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u534f\u52a9\u5e94\u6025\u4eba\u5458\u6267\u884c\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ecd\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002"}}

Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions.

Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u3001\u901a\u8fc7DIR\u52a8\u6001\u4ecb\u5165\u7684\u65b0\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6HPR\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1180%\u89e3\u7801\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u867d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7b54\u6848\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952etoken\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ecb\u5165\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7531\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\uff1a1\uff09Hinter\uff08\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b2\uff09Practitioner\uff08\u9ad8\u6548\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u6267\u884c\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5f15\u5165Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR)\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u671f\u671b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u4ecb\u5165\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6811\u72b6\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6f5c\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cHPR\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ea\u89e3\u78011/5 Token\u7684\u4ee3\u4ef7\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027(Self-consistency)\u548cMCTS\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u9ad85.1%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684FLOPs\u3002", "conclusion": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence.

However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned.

Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684SAM-DAQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9RGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c06 Segment Anything Model (SAM) \u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eRGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce8\u610f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSAM-DAQ\uff08Depth-guided Adaptive Queries\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06SAM2\u9002\u914d\u4e8eRGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5e76\u884c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08PAMIE\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684SAM\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u5e76\u884c\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff08DPA\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff1b2) \u67e5\u8be2\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff08QTM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5e27\u7ea7\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aRGB-D VSOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAM-DAQ\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SAM-DAQ\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SAM\u5728RGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHCC-3D\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec6\u8282\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea698%\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u5e76\u8fbe\u6210SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473D-VLM\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D-VLM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3a3D token\u5e76\u9001\u5165LLM\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5904\u7406\u5168\u90e83D token\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u8865\u507f\u538b\u7f29\uff08HCC-3D\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\uff08GSC\uff09\u5c06\u5168\u90e83D token\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5c11\u91cf\u5173\u952etoken\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec6\u8282\u6316\u6398\uff08ADM\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u507f\u8bc4\u5206\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u538b\u7f29\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f25\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ea698%\u6781\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cHCC-3D\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "HCC-3D\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D-VLM\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining \"contrastive reindexing\" for inter-class isolation and \"constrained cascade generation\" for intra-class protection.

Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "DenoGrad\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u964d\u566a\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u91ca\u578bAI\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e3\u91ca\u578bAI\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u566a\u58f0\u5b9a\u4e49\u901a\u5e38\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u6548\u9002\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u964d\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDenoGrad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0cDenoGrad\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u964d\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u578bAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0cDenoGrad\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u578bAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002"}}

A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition.

Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU.

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \\textit{M}ultimodal framework, \\textit{MTP}, for urban \\textit{T}raffic \\textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities.

However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types.

Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoReal\u5229\u7528LLM\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347NCO\u6a21\u578b\u5728TSPLib\u548cCVRPLib\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff08NCO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ece\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\uff08VRP\uff09\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6cdb\u5316\u5c40\u9650\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fdb\u5316\u5f0f\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff08EvoReal\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u2460\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u2461\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684NCO\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u2462\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "EvoReal\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728TSPLib\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7f29\u5c0f\u81f31.05%\uff0c\u5728CVRPLib\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7f29\u5c0f\u81f32.71%\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\uff0cEvoReal\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question.

By progressively fusing truncated signed distance functions, TSPE-GS reconstructs external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework.

In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength.

Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state. Recent approaches leverage reinforcement learning to learn heuristics by applying deep approximate value iteration. These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u524d\u6cbf\u542f\u53d1\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u5355\u6b65Bellman\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6b65Bellman\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7f\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u6539\u8fdb\u72b6\u6001\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u81f3\u641c\u7d22\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e0e\u524d\u6cbf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66ff\u4ee3\u5355\u6b65Bellman\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u6539\u5584\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u754c\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u524d\u6cbf\u542f\u53d1\u96c6\u6210\u66f4\u65b0\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u5355\u6b65Bellman\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\\%$ to $46.61\\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset.

We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias.

This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDiVE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347ID\u3001OOD\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u5176\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDifference Vector Equalization\uff08DiVE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ea6\u675f\u5dee\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u5e73\u5747\u5411\u91cf\u635f\u5931\uff08AVL\uff09\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u9762\u4fdd\u6301\u5dee\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u6210\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u635f\u5931\uff08PVL\uff09\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u5c42\u9762\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDiVE\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "DiVE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u5dee\u5206\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u53cc\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u529f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u4e86ID\u3001OOD\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images.

However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%.

However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios.

We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features.

Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively. Extensive experiments show that LampQ provides the state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "LampQ\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9010\u5c42\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7c7b\u578b\u654f\u611f\u7684Fisher\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684ViT\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff08ViT\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\uff08MPQ\uff09\u65b9\u6848\u5728ViT\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6307\u6807\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cf\u5316\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLampQ\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u9762\u5411\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u7684\u9010\u5c42\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u654f\u611f\u7684Fisher\u6307\u6807\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u4f18\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "LampQ\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ViT\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "LampQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ViT\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c97\u3001\u6307\u6807\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4ee5\u53ca\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions.

Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions.

However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\\% mAP, +0.8\\% NDS, and +1.3\\% average recall on nuScenes.

A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small.

Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence.

Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation. In both settings, MACHOP consistently produces higher-quality explanations than the standard approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u83b7\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u5f15\u5165\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u89e3\u91ca\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548cMACHOP\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ecf\u4eba\u5de5\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ece\u4f17\u591a\u5019\u9009\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u501f\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u83b7\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9010\u6b65\u89e3\u91ca\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u7f29\u653e\u591a\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MACHOP\uff08Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron\uff09\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u652f\u914d\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u754c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u6709\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u72ec\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u7f51\u683c\u8c1c\u9898\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u7528\u6237\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eMACHOP\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u504f\u597d\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9010\u6b65\u89e3\u91ca\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548cMACHOP\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a novel formalism called S4F Standpoint Logic, which generalises both S4F and standpoint propositional logic and is therefore capable of expressing multi-viewpoint, non-monotonic semantic commitments. We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86S4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u89c2\u70b9\u4e0e\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u6cd5\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0d\u589e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e0e\u6000\u7591\u63a5\u53d7\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\u53ef\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u8bb8\u591a\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u903b\u8f91S4F\u6765\u523b\u753b\u3002\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u5c1a\u672a\u878d\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u89c2\u70b9\u4e0e\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u627f\u8bfa\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f53\u7cfbS4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u8be5\u4f53\u7cfb\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u5e7fS4F\u548c\u547d\u9898\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\uff1b\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u5176\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5355\u8c03\u4e0e\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u60c5\u5f62\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4fe1\u63a5\u53d7\u4e0e\u6000\u7591\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "result": "S4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u8fbe\u591a\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u8bed\u4e49\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0d\u6bd4\u5176\u6784\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u66f4\u96be\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5355\u8c03\u8fd8\u662f\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5f62\u5f0f\u90fd\u7ef4\u6301\u540c\u7ea7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cS4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0d\u589e\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u89c2\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning.

To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs.

This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization.

Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability.

Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness.

However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to (\"where to look\") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail (\"what to select\"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing \"what to select\", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider \"where to look\", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a \"guide-globally, select-locally\" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGridPrune\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u6309\u6587\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\u5206\u914d\u533a\u57df\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u518d\u5c40\u90e8\u9009\u62e9token\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9tokens\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u663e\u8457\u3002\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9token\u526a\u679d\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u201c\u9009\u4ec0\u4e48\u201d(what)\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u201c\u770b\u54ea\u91cc\u201d(where)\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fdd\u7559\u65e0\u5173\u6216\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u501f\u9274\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6ce8\u610f\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGridPrune\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u526a\u679d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u6307\u5bfc\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u7684token\u9884\u7b97\uff08guide-globally\uff09\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b65\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u5185\u6839\u636e\u9884\u7b97\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u9009\u62e9\uff08select-locally\uff09\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u5c40Top-K\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdMLLM\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u5728LLaVA-NeXT-7B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752811.1%\u7684token\u5373\u53ef\u4fdd\u755996.98%\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u526a\u679d\u7387\u4e0b\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad82.34%\u3002", "conclusion": "GridPrune\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u201c\u770b\u54ea\u91cc\u201d\u4e0e\u201c\u9009\u4ec0\u4e48\u201d\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences.

While recent Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods offer promising solutions, most rely on static target domain assumptions and input-invariant adaptation strategies, limiting their effectiveness under continual shifts. In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels.

Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance.

To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics.

This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap.

However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa split-layer MLP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u652f\u4e0e Hadamard \u4e58\u79ef\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347 INR \u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8de8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7b80\u5355\u52a0\u5bbd MLP \u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u5448\u5e73\u65b9\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a split-layer \u7684\u65b0\u578b MLP \u6784\u9020\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 Hadamard \u4e58\u79ef\u6574\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u9636\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0csplit-layer \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8 INR \u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u56fe\u50cf\u62df\u5408\u3001\u4e8c\u7ef4 CT \u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u4e09\u7ef4\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e94\u7ef4\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "split-layer \u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level.

Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "VISTA\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u793e\u4ea4\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u7136\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u591f\u771f\u5b9e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVISTA\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u9012\u5f52\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6Transformer\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u7ed3\u5408\u957f\u671f\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u793e\u4f1a\u4ee4\u724c\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u7075\u6d3b\u5efa\u6a21\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u6210\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u56fe\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u793e\u4ea4\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5c06\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6MADRAS\u57fa\u51c6\u548cSDD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cVISTA\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8f68\u8ff9\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u3002\u5728MADRAS\u4e0a\u5c06\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u4ece2.14%\u964d\u81f30.03%\uff0c\u5728SDD\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347ADE\u3001FDE\u548cminFDE\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "VISTA\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u793e\u4ea4\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets.

However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples.

This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction. TubeRMC outperforms existing methods on two public benchmarks VidSTG and HCSTVG.

Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability.

In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores.

The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion.

Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faH3Former\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u8d85\u56fe\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u53cc\u66f2\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7ec6\u5fae\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u5185\u90e8\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u8bae\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u9057\u6f0f\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u533a\u5206\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faH3Former\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ecetoken\u5230\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u5305\u62ec\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08SAAM\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u52a0\u6743\u8d85\u56fe\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u5c06token\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u53cc\u66f2\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff08HHCL\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "H3Former\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cH3Former\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7c7b\u522b\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context.

Through extensive controlled experiments on a wide range of LLMs, we demonstrate that LLaViT significantly outperforms the baseline LLaVA method on a multitude of benchmarks, even surpassing models with double its parameter count, establishing a more effective approach to vision-language modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLaViT\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u7ed3\u6784\u4f7f\u5176\u540c\u65f6\u5145\u5f53\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7LLaVA\u53ca\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLaVA\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6548\u679c\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLaViT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u65e2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u6539\u8fdb\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u72ec\u7acb\u7684QKV\u6295\u5f71\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9token\u542f\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cLLaViT\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5LLaVA\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u662f\u5176\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "LLaViT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions.

Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset.

Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data.

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns.

Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients.

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5CoTyle\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u7c3f\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u9a71\u52a8\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u521b\u9020\u529b\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7eaf\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoTyle\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u79bb\u6563\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u7c3f\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u968f\u540e\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u5176\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5408\u6210\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u503c\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u5e94\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCoTyle\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u65b0\u9896\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u201c\u98ce\u683c\u503c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u201d\u7684\u7406\u5ff5\u3002"}}

Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning.

Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9DreamBooth\u7b49\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210AI\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u6613\u88ab\u7b80\u5355\u51c0\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\u524a\u5f31\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAntiDB_Purify\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u9632\u62a4\u4e0d\u7a33\u56fa\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316AI\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982DreamBooth\uff09\u5728\u7528\u6237\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9762\u90e8\u8eab\u4efd\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u867d\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53ef\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6AntiDB_Purify\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u51c0\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u51c0\u5316\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u6548\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728AntiDB_Purify\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c0\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ef4\u6301\u9632\u62a4\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5176\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u4f1a\u88ab\u8f7b\u6613\u6d88\u9664\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u51c0\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u7ed9\u7528\u6237\u5e26\u6765\u865a\u5047\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u611f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7814\u53d1\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Real-world environmental challenges such as background clutter, varying illumination, and occlusions pose significant obstacles to effective lane detection, particularly when relying on data-driven approaches that require substantial effort and cost for data collection and annotation. To address these issues, lane detection methods must leverage contextual and global information from surrounding lanes and objects. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS.

However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408YOLOMS\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u673a\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u7ef4\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u98ce\u673a\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u7ef4\u62a4\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408YOLOMS\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6545\u969c\u5206\u6790\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\u3002YOLOMS\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6ed1\u7a97\u88c1\u526a\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u952e\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u518d\u7531\u7ecf\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u7ef4\u62a4\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523090.6%\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ef4\u62a4\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a89%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u98ce\u673a\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8fd0\u7ef4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Results show that the TimeSformer architecture enables discrimination between seizure and normal activity with an average F1-score of 97%.

Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faHIT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u53d6\u817a\u4f53\u4ee3\u66ff\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u5207\u7247\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u75c5\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5904\u7406\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u5207\u7247\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5207\u7247\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHistology-Informed Tiling\uff08HIT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4ece\u5168\u89c6\u91ce\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u817a\u4f53\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u5728ProMPT\u961f\u5217\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728ICGC-C\u548cTCGA-PRAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u817a\u4f53\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728ProMPT\u961f\u5217\u4e0a\u817a\u4f53\u7ea7Dice\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u52300.83\u00b10.17\uff1b\u4ece760\u5f20WSI\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d638\u4e07\u4e2a\u817a\u4f53\uff0cHIT\u4f7f\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0eEMT\u548cMYC\u76f8\u5173\u7684CNV\u4efb\u52a1\u7684AUC\u63d0\u534710%\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa15\u4e2a\u817a\u4f53\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u4e0e\u764c\u75c7\u590d\u53d1\u3001\u81f4\u764c\u7a81\u53d8\u53ca\u9ad8Gleason\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "HIT\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u9636\u6bb5\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6709\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316VLA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u534721.1%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\u5bfc\u81f4\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u89c9\u4e4b\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d45\u663e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u652f\u6491\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemanticVLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u89c6\u89c9\u526a\u679d\u5668\uff08SD-Pruner\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u526a\u679d\u5668\uff08ID-Pruner\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u526a\u679d\u5668\uff08SA-Pruner\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728SigLIP\u548cDINOv2\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u5668\uff08SH-Fuser\uff09\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7a20\u5bc6\u4e0e\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u793a\uff1b3\uff09\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8026\u5408\u5668\uff08SA-Coupler\uff09\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSemanticVLA\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u65b0SOTA\uff1a\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6bd4OpenVLA\u63d0\u9ad821.1%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e3\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e2.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SemanticVLA\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors.

To address this, we propose {\\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings.

To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniVGGT\u901a\u8fc7GeoAdapter\u548c\u968f\u673a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u9ad8\u6548\u878d\u51653D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u75283D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56RGB\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u673a\u5185\u53c2\u3001\u5916\u53c2\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniVGGT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u6001\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1GeoAdapter\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5377\u79ef\u6e10\u8fdb\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u6001\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u76ee/\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cOmniVGGT\u5728\u6709\u8f85\u52a9\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4ec5RGB\u8f93\u5165\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5728\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u8f93\u5165\u83b7\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniVGGT\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8 OBIA-Mamba \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u50cf\u5143\u4e0e\u53cc\u5206\u652f CNN-Mamba \u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u53cc\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u54e8\u51752\u53f7\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u54e8\u51752\u53f7\uff08Sentinel-2\uff09\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u5728\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4e0e\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\uff08LULC\uff09\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u7cca\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8 OBIA-Mamba\uff08MSOM\uff09\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u50cf\u5143\u7684 OBIA-Mamba \u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528 Mamba \u7ed3\u6784\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u53cc\u5206\u652f CNN-Mamba \u67b6\u6784\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u53cc\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u963f\u5c14\u4f2f\u5854\u5730\u533a\u7684\u54e8\u51752\u53f7\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MSOM \u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86 Sentinel-2 \u6570\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u517c\u987e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5730\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}
