Abstract: Culverts and sewer pipes are critical components of drainage systems, and their failure can lead to serious risks to public safety and the environment. In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.
  First, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost. Finally, we investigate few-shot semantic segmentation and its applicability to defect detection. Few-shot learning aims to train models with only limited data available. By employing a bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms, the model achieves richer feature representations and achieves satisfactory results across evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of vision-language tasks, raising interest in their potential use for biometric applications. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs for heterogeneous face recognition (HFR), where enrollment and probe images are from different sensing modalities, including visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal camera. We benchmark multiple open-source MLLMs across several cross-modality scenarios, including VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, and VIS-THERMAL face recognition. The recognition performance of MLLMs is evaluated using biometric protocols and based on different metrics, including Acquire Rate, Equal Error Rate (EER), and True Accept Rate (TAR). Our results reveal substantial performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, particularly under challenging cross-spectral conditions, in spite of recent advances in MLLMs. Our findings highlight the limitations of current MLLMs for HFR and also the importance of rigorous biometric evaluation when considering their deployment in face recognition systems.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models can automate the generation of radiology reports but struggle with accurate visual grounding and factual consistency. Existing models often misalign textual findings with visual evidence, leading to unreliable or weakly grounded predictions. We present CURE, an error-aware curriculum learning framework that improves grounding and report quality without any additional data. CURE fine-tunes a multimodal instructional model on phrase grounding, grounded report generation, and anatomy-grounded report generation using public datasets. The method dynamically adjusts sampling based on model performance, emphasizing harder samples to improve spatial and textual alignment. CURE improves grounding accuracy by +0.37 IoU, boosts report quality by +0.188 CXRFEScore, and reduces hallucinations by 18.6%. CURE is a data-efficient framework that enhances both grounding accuracy and report reliability.

Abstract: Sparse-view Cone-Beam Computed Tomography reconstruction from limited X-ray projections remains a challenging problem in medical imaging due to the inherent undersampling of fine-grained anatomical details, which correspond to high-frequency components. Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.

Abstract: Few-normal shot anomaly detection (FNSAD) aims to detect abnormal regions in images using only a few normal training samples, making the task highly challenging due to limited supervision and the diversity of potential defects. Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of learnable prompts, deviation-based scoring, and the Top-K MIL strategy.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from low dynamic range (LDR) blurry images, which are common in the wild, struggles to recover high dynamic range (HDR) and sharp 3D representations in extreme lighting conditions. Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images. A novel event mapping field is also designed to bridge the physical scene dynamics and actual event sensor output. The two mapping fields are jointly optimized with the NeRF network, leveraging the spatial and temporal dynamic information in events to enhance the sharp HDR 3D representation learning. Experiments on the collected and public datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art deblurring HDR novel view synthesis results with single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events.

Abstract: Bias in chest X-ray classifiers frequently stems from sex- and age-related shortcuts, leading to systematic underdiagnosis of minority subgroups. Previous pixel-space attribute neutralizers, which rely on convolutional encoders, lessen but do not fully remove this attribute leakage at clinically usable edit strengths. This study evaluates whether substituting the U-Net convolutional encoder with a Vision Transformer backbone in the Attribute-Neutral Framework can reduce demographic attribute leakage while preserving diagnostic accuracy. A data-efficient Image Transformer Small (DeiT-S) neutralizer was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI.

Abstract: Recent image generation models have shown impressive progress, yet they often struggle to yield controllable and consistent results when users attempt to edit specific elements within an existing image. Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing. We demonstrate that LASAGNA excels in generating highly consistent and coherent results across multiple image layers simultaneously, enabling diverse post-editing applications that accurately preserve identity and visual effects. LASAGNA-48K and LASAGNABENCH will be publicly released to foster open research in the community. The project page is https://rayjryang.github.io/LASAGNA-Page/.

Abstract: The proliferation of XR devices has made egocentric hand pose estimation a vital task, yet this perspective is inherently challenged by frequent finger occlusions. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the rich information in dorsal hand skin deformation, unlocked by recent advances in dense visual featurizers. We introduce a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a baseline relaxed position. Our evaluation demonstrates that, using only cropped dorsal images, our method reduces the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers >=50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art techniques that depend on the whole hand's geometry and large model backbones. Consequently, our method not only enhances the reliability of downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios but also unlocks new interaction paradigms, such as detecting isometric force for a surface "click" without visible movement while minimizing model size.

Abstract: Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity image generation. However, evaluating their semantic controllability-specifically for fine-grained, single-domain tasks-remains challenging. Standard metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) often fail to detect identity misalignment in such specialized contexts. In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities. We analyze these failure modes through confusion matrices and attribute them to resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity. Our framework provides a rigorous standard for verifying identity consistency in conditional generative models.

Abstract: Most prior deepfake detection methods lack explainable outputs. With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach. Our method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple cross-dataset benchmarks. Implementation details are available at https://github.com/deon1219/rlsbi.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a great endeavour in developing intelligent perception AI systems. However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse CL tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, particularly in fine-grained CL tasks.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in the realm of autonomous driving, as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the driving environment. Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/Yzichen/SuperOcc.

Abstract: Real-time understanding of long video streams remains challenging for multimodal large language models (VLMs) due to redundant frame processing and rapid forgetting of past context. Existing streaming systems rely on fixed-interval decoding or cache pruning, which either produce repetitive outputs or discard crucial temporal information. We introduce Event-VStream, an event-aware framework that represents continuous video as a sequence of discrete, semantically coherent events. Our system detects meaningful state transitions by integrating motion, semantic, and predictive cues, and triggers language generation only at those boundaries. Each event embedding is consolidated into a persistent memory bank, enabling long-horizon reasoning while maintaining low latency. Across OVOBench-Realtime, and long-form Ego4D evaluations, Event-VStream achieves competitive performance. It improves over a VideoLLM-Online-8B baseline by +10.4 points on OVOBench-Realtime, achieves performance close to Flash-VStream-7B despite using only a general-purpose LLaMA-3-8B text backbone, and maintains around 70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour Ego4D streams.

Abstract: The recent surge in popularity of Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 underscores the community's strong interest in multi-image composition tasks. Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm. Code, models and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Few-shot recognition in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery remains a critical bottleneck for real-world applications due to extreme data scarcity. A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) strategies aim to train high-performance models with minimal labeling efforts, only selecting the most informative instances for annotation. Current approaches to evaluating data informativeness predominantly focus on the data's distribution or intrinsic information content and do not directly correlate with downstream task performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, MGRAL utilizes an unsupervised way with fast look-up tables, ensuring feasible deployment. We evaluate MGRAL's active learning performance on detection tasks over PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates the highest AL curve with convincing visualizations, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-driven active object detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has introduced complex security challenges, particularly at the intersection of textual and visual safety. While existing schemes have explored the security vulnerabilities of MLLMs, the investigation into their visual safety boundaries remains insufficient. In this paper, we propose Beyond Visual Safety (BVS), a novel image-text pair jailbreaking framework specifically designed to probe the visual safety boundaries of MLLMs. BVS employs a "reconstruction-then-generation" strategy, leveraging neutralized visual splicing and inductive recomposition to decouple malicious intent from raw inputs, thereby leading MLLMs to be induced into generating harmful images. Experimental results demonstrate that BVS achieves a remarkable jailbreak success rate of 98.21\% against GPT-5 (12 January 2026 release). Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in the visual safety alignment of current MLLMs.

Abstract: This work focuses on national-scale land-use/land-cover (LULC) semantic segmentation using ALOS-2 single-polarization (HH) SAR data over Japan, together with a companion binary water detection task. Building on SAR-W-MixMAE self-supervised pretraining [1], we address common SAR dense-prediction failure modes, boundary over-smoothing, missed thin/slender structures, and rare-class degradation under long-tailed labels, without increasing pipeline complexity. We introduce three lightweight refinements: (i) injecting high-resolution features into multi-scale decoding, (ii) a progressive refine-up head that alternates convolutional refinement and stepwise upsampling, and (iii) an $α$-scale factor that tempers class reweighting within a focal+dice objective. The resulting model yields consistent improvements on the Japan-wide ALOS-2 LULC benchmark, particularly for under-represented classes, and improves water detection across standard evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Fine-grained attribute prediction is essential for fashion retail applications including catalog enrichment, visual search, and recommendation systems. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, "outer fabric" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for current Video Large Language Models. Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use. Remarkably, VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval and zoom reasoning for long-form video understanding.

Abstract: An essential technique for diagnosing brain disorders is electrophysiological source imaging (ESI). While model-based optimization and deep learning methods have achieved promising results in this field, the accurate selection and refinement of features remains a central challenge for precise ESI. This paper proposes FAIR-ESI, a novel framework that adaptively refines feature importance across different views, including FFT-based spectral feature refinement, weighted temporal feature refinement, and self-attention-based patch-wise feature refinement. Extensive experiments on two simulation datasets with diverse configurations and two real-world clinical datasets validate our framework's efficacy, highlighting its potential to advance brain disorder diagnosis and offer new insights into brain function.

Abstract: The successful adaptation of foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging is a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing models often struggle to effectively fuse information from multiple sources and adapt to the heterogeneous nature of pathological tissues. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for adapting foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging, featuring two key technical innovations: sub-region-aware modality attention and adaptive prompt engineering. The attention mechanism enables the model to learn the optimal combination of modalities for each tumor sub-region, while the adaptive prompting strategy leverages the inherent capabilities of foundation models to refine segmentation accuracy. We validate our framework on the BraTS 2020 brain tumor segmentation dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, particularly in the challenging necrotic core sub-region. Our work provides a principled and effective approach to multi-modal fusion and prompting, paving the way for more accurate and robust foundation model-based solutions in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep image steganography (DIS) has achieved significant results in capacity and invisibility. However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity.

Abstract: In hyperspectral image classification (HSIC), most deep learning models rely on opaque spectral-spatial feature mixing, limiting their interpretability and hindering understanding of internal decision mechanisms. We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics. Furthermore, we find that increasing the expansion rate accelerates the emergence of structured interaction patterns. These results suggest that ES-mHC transforms HSIC from a purely black-box prediction task into a structurally transparent, partially white-box learning process.

Abstract: This paper presents FeTal-SAM, a novel adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) tailored for fetal brain MRI segmentation. Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages. Notably, it achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines which were trained for each dataset and label definition for well-contrasted structures like cortical plate and cerebellum, while maintaining the flexibility to segment any user-specified anatomy. Although slightly lower accuracy is observed for subtle, low-contrast structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala), our results highlight FeTal-SAM's potential to serve as a general-purpose segmentation model without exhaustive retraining. This method thus constitutes a promising step toward clinically adaptable fetal brain MRI analysis tools.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in low-light image enhancement with respect to visual quality. However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that LL-GaussianMap achieves superior enhancement performance with an extremely low storage footprint, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit Gaussian representations for image enhancement.

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is an emerging explicit scene representation method with significant potential for image compression due to high fidelity and high compression ratios. However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain. Processing 2DGS-compressed images necessitates a cumbersome decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline, which compromises efficiency and introduces secondary degradation. To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced. High-quality enhancement of low-light images is achieved while high compression ratios are maintained. The feasibility and superiority of the paradigm for direct processing within the compressed representation domain are validated through experimental results.

Abstract: Neuron segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) aims to reconstruct the complete neuronal connectome; however, current deep learning-based methods are limited by their reliance on large-scale training data and extensive, time-consuming manual annotations. Traditional methods augment the training set through geometric and photometric transformations; however, the generated samples remain highly correlated with the original images and lack structural diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism. Together, these components effectively enrich the training set and improve segmentation performance. On the AC3 and AC4 datasets under low-annotation regimes, our method improves the ARAND metric by 32.1% and 30.7%, respectively, when combined with two different post-processing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HeadLiuYun/NeuroDiff.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) remains fragile when semantics hinge on subtle temporal or geometric cues. We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks. A simple aid, stable color cues, partly reduces assailant role confusions but does not resolve the underlying weakness. By releasing data and code, we aim to provide reproducible diagnostics and seed exploration of lightweight spatial priors to complement large-scale pretraining.

Abstract: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm that has been specifically designed for computer vision applications. The CNNs proved successful in handling the increasing amount of data in many computer vision problems, where classical machine learning algorithms were insufficient. Flowers have many uses in our daily lives, from decorating to making medicines to detoxifying the environment. Identifying flower types requires expert knowledge. However, accessing experts at any time and in any location may not always be feasible. In this study a mobile application based on CNNs was developed to recognize different types of flowers to provide non-specialists with quick and easy access to information about flower types. The study employed three distinct CNN models, namely MobileNet, DenseNet121, and Xception, to determine the most suitable model for the mobile application. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score. This result shows that CNNs can be used for flower classification in mobile applications.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight experimentation pipeline designed to lower the barrier for applying machine learning (ML) methods for classifying images in ecological research. We enable ecologists to experiment with ML models independently, thus they can move beyond off-the-shelf models and generate insights tailored to local datasets and specific classification tasks and target variables. Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies. Our best-performing models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age classification and 96.15% for sex classification. These results demonstrate that reliable demographic classification is feasible even with limited data to answer narrow, well-defined ecological problems. More broadly, the framework provides ecologists with an accessible tool for developing ML models tailored to specific research questions, paving the way for broader adoption of ML in wildlife monitoring and demographic analysis.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of deep learning in remote sensing image interpretation, driven by the availability of large-scale benchmark datasets. However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training. Code and pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/DPD).

Abstract: The increasing global demand for sustainable agriculture necessitates intelligent monitoring systems that optimize resource utilization and plant health management. Traditional farming methods rely on manual observation and periodic watering, often leading to water wastage, inconsistent plant growth, and delayed response to environmental changes. This paper presents a comprehensive IoT-based smart plant monitoring system that integrates multiple environmental sensors with automated irrigation and cloud analytics. The proposed system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect real-time data from DHT22 (temperature/humidity), HC-SR04 (water level), and soil moisture sensors, with visual feedback through an OLED display and auditory alerts via a buzzer. All sensor data is wirelessly transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for remote monitoring, historical analysis, and automated alert generation. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels (with 92\% accuracy), providing real-time environmental monitoring, and reducing water consumption by approximately 40\% compared to conventional irrigation methods. The integrated web dashboard offers comprehensive visualization of plant health parameters, making it suitable for both small-scale gardening and commercial agriculture applications. With a total implementation cost of \$45.20, this system provides an affordable, scalable solution for precision agriculture and smart farming.

Abstract: With the growing demand for device-free and privacy-preserving sensing solutions, Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a promising approach for human pose estimation (HPE). However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x. The code repository is available online at here.

Abstract: Background: Coronary angiography (CAG) is a cornerstone imaging modality for assessing coronary artery disease and guiding interventional treatment decisions. However, in real-world clinical settings, angiographic images are often characterized by complex lesion morphology, severe class imbalance, label uncertainty, and limited computational resources, posing substantial challenges to conventional deep learning approaches in terms of robustness and generalization.Methods: The proposed framework is built upon a pretrained convolutional neural network to construct a lightweight hybrid neural representation. A selective neural plasticity training strategy is introduced to enable efficient parameter adaptation. Furthermore, a brain-inspired attention-modulated loss function, combining Focal Loss with label smoothing, is employed to enhance sensitivity to hard samples and uncertain annotations. Class-imbalance-aware sampling and cosine annealing with warm restarts are adopted to mimic rhythmic regulation and attention allocation mechanisms observed in biological neural systems.Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight brain-inspired model achieves strong and stable performance in binary coronary angiography classification, yielding competitive accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics while maintaining high computational efficiency.Conclusion: This study validates the effectiveness of brain-inspired learning mechanisms in lightweight medical image analysis and provides a biologically plausible and deployable solution for intelligent clinical decision support under limited computational resources.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to securing machine learning model deployments against potential distribution shifts in practical applications, the Total Variation Out-of-Distribution (TV-OOD) detection method. Existing methods have produced satisfactory results, but TV-OOD improves upon these by leveraging the Total Variation Network Estimator to calculate each input's contribution to the overall total variation. By defining this as the total variation score, TV-OOD discriminates between in- and out-of-distribution data. The method's efficacy was tested across a range of models and datasets, consistently yielding results in image classification tasks that were either comparable or superior to those achieved by leading-edge out-of-distribution detection techniques across all evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Contrast medium plays a pivotal role in radiological imaging, as it amplifies lesion conspicuity and improves detection for the diagnosis of tumor-related diseases. However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation. We release the dataset and benchmark to catalyze research on safe, effective contrast synthesis, with direct relevance to multi-organ oncology imaging workflows. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/YifanChen02/PMPBench.

By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision language models guide the learning of visual representations; however, this form of supervision is constrained by the availability of paired image text data, raising the question of whether robust radiology encoders can be learned without relying on language supervision. In this work, we introduce RadJEPA, a self-supervised framework built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that learns without language supervision. Pre-trained solely on unlabeled chest X-ray images, the model learns to predict latent representations of masked image regions. This predictive objective differs fundamentally from both image text pre-training and DINO-style self-distillation: rather than aligning global representations across views or modalities, RadJEPA explicitly models latent-space prediction. We evaluate the learned encoder on disease classification, semantic segmentation, and report generation tasks. Across benchmarks, RadJEPA achieves performance exceeding state-of-the-art approaches, including Rad-DINO.

Abstract: Understanding where and how emotions are represented in large-scale foundation models remains an open problem, particularly in multimodal affective settings. Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\texttt{gate\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \texttt{gate\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \texttt{gate\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.

Abstract: In the realm of Virtual Reality (VR) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), real-time emotion recognition shows promise for supporting individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in improving social skills. This task requires a strict latency-accuracy trade-off, with motion-to-photon (MTP) latency kept below 140 ms to maintain contingency. However, most off-the-shelf Deep Learning models prioritize accuracy over the strict timing constraints of commodity hardware. As a first step toward accessible VR therapy, we benchmark State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition (FER) on virtual characters using the UIBVFED dataset. We evaluate Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, and v12) for face detection, alongside general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and ViT-FER.Our results on CPU-only inference demonstrate that while face detection on stylized avatars is robust (100% accuracy), a "Latency Wall" exists in the classification stage. The YOLOv11n architecture offers the optimal balance for detection (~54 ms). However, general-purpose Transformers like CLIP and SigLIP fail to achieve viable accuracy (<23%) or speed (>150 ms) for real-time loops. This study highlights the necessity for lightweight, domain-specific architectures to enable accessible, real-time AI in therapeutic settings.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate 3D hand pose estimation supports surgical applications such as skill assessment, robot-assisted interventions, and geometry-aware workflow analysis. However, surgical environments pose severe challenges, including intense and localized lighting, frequent occlusions by instruments or staff, and uniform hand appearance due to gloves, combined with a scarcity of annotated datasets for reliable model training.
  Method: We propose a robust multi-view pipeline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgical contexts that requires no domain-specific fine-tuning and relies solely on off-the-shelf pretrained models. The pipeline integrates reliable person detection, whole-body pose estimation, and state-of-the-art 2D hand keypoint prediction on tracked hand crops, followed by a constrained 3D optimization. In addition, we introduce a novel surgical benchmark dataset comprising over 68,000 frames and 3,000 manually annotated 2D hand poses with triangulated 3D ground truth, recorded in a replica operating room under varying levels of scene complexity.
  Results: Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 31% reduction in 2D mean joint error and a 76% reduction in 3D mean per-joint position error.
  Conclusion: Our work establishes a strong baseline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgery, providing both a training-free pipeline and a comprehensive annotated dataset to facilitate future research in surgical computer vision.

Abstract: Deep neural network models degrade significantly in the long-tailed data distribution, with the overall training data dominated by a small set of classes in the head, and the tail classes obtaining less training examples. Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits. In the practical implementation stage of the proposed scheme, we use an Ω(p_t, f_c) function. This function enables the modulation of the contribution towards the training task based upon the confidence value of the prediction, as well as the relative frequency of the corresponding class. Our observations in the experiments are corroborated by significant experimental results performed on the CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets under various values of imbalance factors that clearly authenticate the theoretical discussions above.

Abstract: Neuron segmentation is the cornerstone of reconstructing comprehensive neuronal connectomes, which is essential for deciphering the functional organization of the brain. The irregular morphology and densely intertwined structures of neurons make this task particularly challenging. Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions. The source code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of static and dynamic urban scenes is essential for autonomous driving simulation, yet existing methods often struggle to balance reconstruction time with quality. While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art performance but often fail to generate outputs that align with human preferences and intentions, resulting in images with poor aesthetic quality and semantic inconsistencies. Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking. We evaluate HyperAlign on multiple extended generative paradigms, including Stable Diffusion and FLUX. It significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal.

Abstract: Modern foundational Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video world models have advanced significantly in mathematical, common-sense, and visual reasoning, but their grasp of the underlying physics remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models. Our data will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The emergence of visual foundation models has revolutionized visual odometry~(VO) and SLAM, enabling pose estimation and dense reconstruction within a single feed-forward network. However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.

Abstract: Virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) aims to computationally synthesize molecular staining patterns from routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) images, offering a cost-effective and tissue-efficient alternative to traditional physical staining. However, this task is particularly challenging: H\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis. Experiments on the IHC4BC and MIST datasets demonstrate that PAINT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural fidelity and clinical downstream tasks, validating the potential of structure-guided autoregressive modeling.

Abstract: Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by leveraging the powerful perception abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand environments and directly output actions. However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across diverse vision tasks. However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines. These results demonstrate significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments.

Abstract: Human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and digital content creation, but remains challenging under frequent occlusions in real-world settings.Existing regression-based methods are efficient but fragile to missing observations, while optimization- and diffusion-based approaches improve robustness at the cost of slow inference speed and heavy preprocessing steps. To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.

Abstract: Pixel-wise capabilities are essential for building interactive intelligent systems. However, pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remain difficult to scale due to complex region-level encoders, specialized segmentation decoders, and incompatible training objectives. To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a scalable and straightforward paradigm for equipping MLLMs with strong pixel-wise capabilities. Our code and models are available.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a pivotal and complex task in multimodal understanding. Current CIR benchmarks typically feature limited query categories and fail to capture the diverse requirements of real-world scenarios. To bridge this evaluation gap, we leverage image editing to achieve precise control over modification types and content, enabling a pipeline for synthesizing queries across a broad spectrum of categories. Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage. Furthermore, an in-domain training experiment demonstrates the feasibility of our benchmark. This experiment clarifies the task challenges by distinguishing between categories that are solvable with targeted data and those that expose intrinsic limitations of current model architectures.

Abstract: Existing approaches for watermarking AI-generated images often rely on post-hoc methods applied in pixel space, introducing computational overhead and potential visual artifacts. In this work, we explore latent space watermarking and introduce DistSeal, a unified approach for latent watermarking that works across both diffusion and autoregressive models. Our approach works by training post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models. We demonstrate that these latent watermarkers can be effectively distilled either into the generative model itself or into the latent decoder, enabling in-model watermarking. The resulting latent watermarks achieve competitive robustness while offering similar imperceptibility and up to 20x speedup compared to pixel-space baselines. Our experiments further reveal that distilling latent watermarkers outperforms distilling pixel-space ones, providing a solution that is both more efficient and more robust.

Abstract: Generating animated 3D objects is at the heart of many applications, yet most advanced works are typically difficult to apply in practice because of their limited setup, their long runtime, or their limited quality. We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes "in action" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed "temporal 3D diffusion". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.

Abstract: Discrete video VAEs underpin modern text-to-video generation and video understanding systems, yet existing tokenizers typically learn visual codebooks at a single scale with limited vocabularies and shallow language supervision, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and zero-shot transfer. We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study Compositional Video Understanding (CVU), where models must recognize verbs and objects and compose them to generalize to unseen combinations. We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.

Abstract: Lifting perspective images and videos to 360° panoramas enables immersive 3D world generation. Existing approaches often rely on explicit geometric alignment between the perspective and the equirectangular projection (ERP) space. Yet, this requires known camera metadata, obscuring the application to in-the-wild data where such calibration is typically absent or noisy. We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers. By treating the perspective input and the panorama target simply as token sequences, 360Anything learns the perspective-to-equirectangular mapping in a purely data-driven way, eliminating the need for camera information. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360° generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks. Additional results are available at https://360anything.github.io/.

Abstract: Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) have shown distinct advantages in diffusion modeling on ImageNet by training in high-dimensional semantic latent spaces. In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models.

Abstract: Recent advances in camera-controlled video diffusion models have significantly improved video-camera alignment. However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The computational burden of attention in long-context language models has motivated two largely independent lines of work: sparse attention mechanisms that reduce complexity by attending to selected tokens, and gated attention variants that improve training sta-bility while mitigating the attention sink phenomenon. We observe that these approaches address complementary weaknesses and propose Gated Sparse Attention (GSA), an architecture that realizes the benefits of both. GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%. Training stability improves markedly, with loss spikes reduced by 98%.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their integration into clinical decision-making; however, hidden biases against patients across racial, social, economic, and clinical backgrounds persist. In this study, we investigate bias in LLM-based medical AI systems applied to emergency department (ED) triage. We employ 32 patient-level proxy variables, each represented by paired positive and negative qualifiers, and evaluate their effects using both public (MIMIC-IV-ED Demo, MIMIC-IV Demo) and restricted-access credentialed (MIMIC-IV-ED and MIMIC-IV) datasets as appropriate~\cite{mimiciv_ed_demo,mimiciv_ed,mimiciv}. Our results reveal discriminatory behavior mediated through proxy variables in ED triage scenarios, as well as a systematic tendency for LLMs to modify perceived patient severity when specific tokens appear in the input context, regardless of whether they are framed positively or negatively. These findings indicate that AI systems is still imperfectly trained on noisy, sometimes non-causal signals that do not reliably reflect true patient acuity. Consequently, more needs to be done to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AI technologies in clinical settings.

Abstract: The rapid development of automated scientific survey generation technology has made it increasingly important to establish a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the quality of generated surveys.Nearly all existing evaluation benchmarks rely on flawed selection criteria such as citation counts and structural coherence to select human-written surveys as the ground truth survey datasets, and then use surface-level metrics such as structural quality and reference relevance to evaluate generated surveys.However, these benchmarks have two key issues: (1) the ground truth survey datasets are unreliable because of a lack academic dimension annotations; (2) the evaluation metrics only focus on the surface quality of the survey such as logical coherence. Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep "academic value", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys. Specifically, our benchmark propose a comprehensive academic value evaluation criteria covering three dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value. Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our benchmark is highly consistent with human performance in assessing the academic value of generated surveys.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally constrained by the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon, where reasoning capabilities degrade as context windows expand. Existing solutions, primarily "Flat RAG" architectures relying on vector databases, treat memory as an unstructured bag of embeddings. This approach fails to capture the hierarchical and temporal structure of long-horizon interactions, leading to "Vector Haze", the retrieval of disjointed facts lacking episodic continuity. We propose Aeon, a Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Operating System that redefines memory not as a static store, but as a managed OS resource. Aeon structures memory into a Memory Palace (a spatial index implemented via Atlas, a SIMD-accelerated Page-Clustered Vector Index that combines small-world graph navigation with B+ Tree-style disk locality to minimize read amplification) and a Trace (a neuro-symbolic episodic graph). We introduce the Semantic Lookaside Buffer (SLB), a predictive caching mechanism that exploits conversational locality to achieve sub-millisecond retrieval latencies. Benchmarks demonstrate that Aeon achieves < 1ms retrieval latency on conversational workloads while ensuring state consistency via a zero-copy C++/Python bridge, effectively enabling persistent, structured memory for autonomous agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has driven a paradigm shift in multimodal fake news detection (MFND), transforming it from traditional feature-engineering approaches to unified, end-to-end multimodal reasoning frameworks. Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

Abstract: LLM agents struggle with regulatory audit replay: when asked to reproduce a flagged transaction decision with identical inputs, most deployments fail to return consistent results. This paper introduces the Determinism-Faithfulness Assurance Harness (DFAH), a framework for measuring trajectory determinism and evidence-conditioned faithfulness in tool-using agents deployed in financial services.
  Across 74 configurations (12 models, 4 providers, 8-24 runs each at T=0.0) in non-agentic baseline experiments, 7-20B parameter models achieved 100% determinism, while 120B+ models required 3.7x larger validation samples to achieve equivalent statistical reliability. Agentic tool-use introduces additional variance (see Tables 4-7). Contrary to the assumed reliability-capability trade-off, a positive Pearson correlation emerged (r = 0.45, p < 0.01, n = 51 at T=0.0) between determinism and faithfulness; models producing consistent outputs also tended to be more evidence-aligned.
  Three financial benchmarks are provided (compliance triage, portfolio constraints, DataOps exceptions; 50 cases each) along with an open-source stress-test harness. In these benchmarks and under DFAH evaluation settings, Tier 1 models with schema-first architectures achieved determinism levels consistent with audit replay requirements.

Abstract: Adding memory to pretrained language models typically requires architectural changes or weight modification. We present Prometheus Mind, which retrofits memory to a frozen Qwen3-4B using 11 modular adapters (530MB, 7% overhead) -- fully reversible by removing the adapters. Building this system required solving four problems: (1) Extraction -- we develop Contrastive Direction Discovery (CDD), which finds semantic directions via minimal pairs without labeled data. (2) Training -- end-to-end optimization collapses; stage-wise training of each adapter on simple proxy tasks succeeds. (3) Injection -- learned encoders fail to generalize; we find that lm_head.weight rows already provide the mapping we need, requiring no training. (4) Hidden state collapse -- transformers make ``wife'' and ``brother'' 0.98+ similar; we train projections to recover distinction (0.98 $\rightarrow$ 0.09). On PrometheusExtract-132 (132 cases), the system achieves 94.4% retrieval on clean inputs (n=54, 95% CI: [84.9%, 98.1%]), degrading to 19.4% on informal inputs with ellipsis, filler words, or implicit subjects (n=36). The primary bottleneck is relation classification (47.3% accuracy), responsible for most extraction errors.

Abstract: The rash development of knowledge graph research has brought big driving force to its application in many areas, including the medicine and healthcare domain. However, we have found that the application of some major information processing techniques on knowledge graph still lags behind. This defect includes the failure to make sufficient use of advanced logic reasoning, advanced artificial intelligence techniques, special-purpose programming languages, modern probabilistic and statistic theories et al. on knowledge graphs development and application. In particular, the multiple knowledge graphs cooperation and competition techniques have not got enough attention from researchers. This paper develops a systematic theory, technique and application of the concept 'knowledge graph network' and its application in medical and healthcare domain. Our research covers its definition, development, reasoning, computing and application under different conditions such as unsharp, uncertain, multi-modal, vectorized, distributed, federated. Almost in each case we provide (real data) examples and experiment results. Finally, a conclusion of innovation is provided.

Abstract: Biomedical research increasingly relies on integrating diverse data modalities, including gene expression profiles, medical images, and clinical metadata. While medical images and clinical metadata are routinely collected in clinical practice, gene expression data presents unique challenges for widespread research use, mainly due to stringent privacy regulations and costly laboratory experiments. To address these limitations, we present GeMM-GAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network conditioned on histopathology tissue slides and clinical metadata, designed to synthesize realistic gene expression profiles. GeMM-GAN combines a Transformer Encoder for image patches with a final Cross Attention mechanism between patches and text tokens, producing a conditioning vector to guide a generative model in generating biologically coherent gene expression profiles. We evaluate our approach on the TCGA dataset and demonstrate that our framework outperforms standard generative models and generates more realistic and functionally meaningful gene expression profiles, improving by more than 11\% the accuracy on downstream disease type prediction compared to current state-of-the-art generative models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid emergence of new entities -- driven by cultural shifts, evolving trends, and personalized user data -- poses a significant challenge for existing Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from "over-correction", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.
  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length. Extensive experiments using the Phi-4-MM model across 11 multilingual locales demonstrate that LOGIC achieves an average 9% relative reduction in Entity WER with a negligible 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate.

Abstract: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.

Abstract: The unification of neural and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence remains a central open challenge. In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism, which captures sparsity principles originating in the different approaches in tensor decompositions. In particular, we describe a basis encoding scheme for functions and model neural decompositions as tensor decompositions. The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network. The theoretical concepts are accompanied by the python library tnreason, which enables the implementation and practical use of the proposed architectures.

Abstract: This paper examines how to make large language models reliable for high-stakes legal work by reducing hallucinations. It distinguishes three AI paradigms: (1) standalone generative models ("creative oracle"), (2) basic retrieval-augmented systems ("expert archivist"), and (3) an advanced, end-to-end optimized RAG system ("rigorous archivist"). The authors introduce two reliability metrics -False Citation Rate (FCR) and Fabricated Fact Rate (FFR)- and evaluate 2,700 judicial-style answers from 12 LLMs across 75 legal tasks using expert, double-blind review. Results show that standalone models are unsuitable for professional use (FCR above 30%), while basic RAG greatly reduces errors but still leaves notable misgrounding. Advanced RAG, using techniques such as embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, and self-correction, reduces fabrication to negligible levels (below 0.2%). The study concludes that trustworthy legal AI requires rigor-focused, retrieval-based architectures emphasizing verification and traceability, and provides an evaluation framework applicable to other high-risk domains.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) toward multimodal, high-stakes enterprise applications has outpaced the development of domain specific evaluation benchmarks. Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.

Abstract: A common solution for mitigating outdated or incorrect information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is to provide updated facts in-context or through knowledge editing. However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: The use of Transfer Learning & Transformers has steadily improved accuracy and has significantly contributed in solving complex computation problems. However, this transformer led accuracy improvement in Applied AI Analytics specifically in sentiment analytics comes with the dark side. It is observed during experiments that a lot of these improvements in transformer led accuracy of one class of sentiment has been at the cost of polarization of another class of sentiment and the failing of neutrality. This lack of neutrality poses an acute problem in the Applied NLP space, which relies heavily on the computational outputs of sentiment analytics for reliable industry ready tasks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic crash severity is critical for improving emergency response and public safety planning. Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.

Abstract: A world model is an AI system that simulates how an environment evolves under actions, enabling planning through imagined futures rather than reactive perception. Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.

Abstract: Personalized learning systems have emerged as a promising approach to enhance student outcomes by tailoring educational content, pacing, and feedback to individual needs. However, most existing systems remain fragmented, specializing in either knowledge tracing, diagnostic modeling, or resource recommendation, but rarely integrating these components into a cohesive adaptive cycle. In this paper, we propose ALIGNAgent (Adaptive Learner Intelligence for Gap Identification and Next-step guidance), a multi-agent educational framework designed to deliver personalized learning through integrated knowledge estimation, skill-gap identification, and targeted resource recommendation.ALIGNAgent begins by processing student quiz performance, gradebook data, and learner preferences to generate topic-level proficiency estimates using a Skill Gap Agent that employs concept-level diagnostic reasoning to identify specific misconceptions and knowledge deficiencies. After identifying skill gaps, the Recommender Agent retrieves preference-aware learning materials aligned with diagnosed deficiencies, implementing a continuous feedback loop where interventions occur before advancing to subsequent topics. Extensive empirical evaluation on authentic datasets from two undergraduate computer science courses demonstrates ALIGNAgent's effectiveness, with GPT-4o-based agents achieving precision of 0.87-0.90 and F1 scores of 0.84-0.87 in knowledge proficiency estimation validated against actual exam performance.

Abstract: Current business environments require organizations to continuously reconfigure cross-functional processes, yet enterprise systems are still organized around siloed departments, rigid workflows, and hard-coded automation. Meanwhile large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting natural language and unstructured data but lack deterministic, verifiable execution of complex business logic. To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability. We detail the AUTOBUS architecture, the anatomy of the AI agent generated logic programs, and the role of humans and auxiliary tools in the lifecycle of a business initiative.

Abstract: Whether Large Language Models (LLMs) truly possess human-like Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities has garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks remain largely restricted to narrow paradigms like false belief tasks, failing to capture the full spectrum of human cognitive mechanisms. We introduce CogToM, a comprehensive, theoretically grounded benchmark comprising over 8000 bilingual instances across 46 paradigms, validated by 49 human annotator.A systematic evaluation of 22 representative models, including frontier models like GPT-5.1 and Qwen3-Max, reveals significant performance heterogeneities and highlights persistent bottlenecks in specific dimensions. Further analysis based on human cognitive patterns suggests potential divergences between LLM and human cognitive structures. CogToM offers a robust instrument and perspective for investigating the evolving cognitive boundaries of LLMs.

Abstract: Healthcare organizations are beginning to embed agentic AI into routine workflows, including clinical documentation support and early-warning monitoring. As these capabilities diffuse across departments and vendors, health systems face agent sprawl, causing duplicated agents, unclear accountability, inconsistent controls, and tool permissions that persist beyond the original use case. Existing AI governance frameworks emphasize lifecycle risk management but provide limited guidance for the day-to-day operations of agent fleets. We propose a Unified Agent Lifecycle Management (UALM) blueprint derived from a rapid, practice-oriented synthesis of governance standards, agent security literature, and healthcare compliance requirements. UALM maps recurring gaps onto five control-plane layers: (1) an identity and persona registry, (2) orchestration and cross-domain mediation, (3) PHI-bounded context and memory, (4) runtime policy enforcement with kill-switch triggers, and (5) lifecycle management and decommissioning linked to credential revocation and audit logging. A companion maturity model supports staged adoption. UALM offers healthcare CIOs, CISOs, and clinical leaders an implementable pattern for audit-ready oversight that preserves local innovation and enables safer scaling across clinical and administrative domains.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- generations that are plausible but factually unfaithful -- remain a critical barrier to high-stakes deployment. Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).
  Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises ("Sycophancy").
  This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.

Abstract: The rapid rise of autonomous AI systems and advancements in agent capabilities are introducing new risks due to reduced oversight of real-world interactions. Yet agent testing remains nascent and is still a developing science. As AI agents begin to be deployed globally, it is important that they handle different languages and cultures accurately and securely.
  To address this, participants from The International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the European Commission, France, Kenya, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have come together to align approaches to agentic evaluations.
  This is the third exercise, building on insights from two earlier joint testing exercises conducted by the Network in November 2024 and February 2025. The objective is to further refine best practices for testing advanced AI systems.
  The exercise was split into two strands: (1) common risks, including leakage of sensitive information and fraud, led by Singapore AISI; and (2) cybersecurity, led by UK AISI. A mix of open and closed-weight models were evaluated against tasks from various public agentic benchmarks. Given the nascency of agentic testing, our primary focus was on understanding methodological issues in conducting such tests, rather than examining test results or model capabilities. This collaboration marks an important step forward as participants work together to advance the science of agentic evaluations.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their unreliability remains a critical barrier to deployment in high-stakes domains. This survey charts a functional evolution in addressing this challenge: the evolution of uncertainty from a passive diagnostic metric to an active control signal guiding real-time model behavior. We demonstrate how uncertainty is leveraged as an active control signal across three frontiers: in \textbf{advanced reasoning} to optimize computation and trigger self-correction; in \textbf{autonomous agents} to govern metacognitive decisions about tool use and information seeking; and in \textbf{reinforcement learning} to mitigate reward hacking and enable self-improvement via intrinsic rewards. By grounding these advancements in emerging theoretical frameworks like Bayesian methods and Conformal Prediction, we provide a unified perspective on this transformative trend. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, critical analysis, and practical design patterns, arguing that mastering the new trend of uncertainty is essential for building the next generation of scalable, reliable, and trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Although AI agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in long-horizon reasoning, their reliability is severely hampered by the ``Spiral of Hallucination,'' where early epistemic errors propagate irreversibly. Existing methods face a dilemma: uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods typically act as passive sensors, only diagnosing risks without addressing them, while self-reflection mechanisms suffer from continuous or aimless corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration. We believe this principled framework AUQ represents a significant step towards reliable agents.

Abstract: As frontier AI models are deployed globally, it is essential that their behaviour remains safe and reliable across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. To examine how current model safeguards hold up in such settings, participants from the International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the EU, France, Kenya, South Korea and the UK conducted a joint multilingual evaluation exercise. Led by Singapore AISI, two open-weight models were tested across ten languages spanning high and low resourced groups: Cantonese English, Farsi, French, Japanese, Korean, Kiswahili, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Telugu. Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.
  The exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages. These include differences in safeguard robustness across languages and harm types and variation in evaluator reliability (LLM-as-judge vs. human review). Further, it also generated methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations, such as the need for culturally contextualised translations, stress-tested evaluator prompts and clearer human annotation guidelines. This work represents an initial step toward a shared framework for multilingual safety testing of advanced AI systems and calls for continued collaboration with the wider research community and industry.

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL remains the dominant approach for database interaction, real-world analytics increasingly require the flexibility of general-purpose programming languages such as Python or Pandas to manage file-based data and complex analytical workflows. Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

Abstract: The combination of verifiable languages and LLMs has significantly influenced both the mathematical and computer science communities because it provides a rigorous foundation for theorem proving. Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains. To foster further research, we will release both our dataset and model to the community.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental form of data structure. The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning in the real world remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, sparse rewards, and noisy visual observations. Prior work leverages demonstrations and human feedback to improve learning efficiency and robustness. However, offline-to-online methods need large datasets and can be unstable, while VLA-assisted RL relies on large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning. As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.

Abstract: AI agents are rapidly advancing from passive language models to autonomous systems executing complex, multi-step tasks. Yet their overconfidence in failure remains a fundamental barrier to deployment in high-stakes settings. Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.

Abstract: Many theorists of creativity maintain that intentional agency is a necessary condition of creativity. We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products. Nonetheless, we explain why the IAC should be retained in specific local domains.

Abstract: Chronic diseases have become the leading cause of death worldwide, a challenge intensified by strained medical resources and an aging population. Individually, patients often struggle to interpret early signs of deterioration or maintain adherence to care plans. In this paper, we introduce VitalDiagnosis, an LLM-driven ecosystem designed to shift chronic disease management from passive monitoring to proactive, interactive engagement. By integrating continuous data from wearable devices with the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the system addresses both acute health anomalies and routine adherence. It analyzes triggers through context-aware inquiries, produces provisional insights within a collaborative patient-clinician workflow, and offers personalized guidance. This approach aims to promote a more proactive and cooperative care paradigm, with the potential to enhance patient self-management and reduce avoidable clinical workload.

Abstract: Recent advances in Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are transforming automated knowledge discovery and problem-solving. While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification. These examples emphasize reflection and self-critique, enabling open models to develop robust verification capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) benchmarks tell us when models fail, but not why they fail. A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique "failure signature", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.

Abstract: The development of native computer-use agents (CUA) represents a significant leap in multimodal AI. However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%). Crucially, our results underscore the generalizability of this approach: the evolving paradigm driven by learning from experience yields consistent performance gains across foundation models of varying scales, establishing a robust and scalable path for advancing native agent capabilities.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) holds unique value in real-world surveillance bridging visual perception and language understanding, yet current paradigms utilizing pre-training models often fail to transfer effectively to complex open-world scenarios. The reliance on "Passive Observation" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.

Abstract: Planetary surfaces are typically analyzed using high-level semantic concepts in natural language, yet vast orbital image archives remain organized at the pixel level. This mismatch limits scalable, open-ended exploration of planetary surfaces. Here we present MarScope, a planetary-scale vision-language framework enabling natural language-driven, label-free mapping of Martian landforms. MarScope aligns planetary images and text in a shared semantic space, trained on over 200,000 curated image-text pairs. This framework transforms global geomorphic mapping on Mars by replacing pre-defined classifications with flexible semantic retrieval, enabling arbitrary user queries across the entire planet in 5 seconds with F1 scores up to 0.978. Applications further show that it extends beyond morphological classification to facilitate process-oriented analysis and similarity-based geomorphological mapping at a planetary scale. MarScope establishes a new paradigm where natural language serves as a direct interface for scientific discovery over massive geospatial datasets.

Abstract: The Decision Transformer (DT) has established a powerful sequence modeling approach to offline reinforcement learning. It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT). DDT simplifies the architecture by processing only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG to guide the action prediction. This streamlined approach not only improves performance but also reduces computational cost. Our experiments show that DDT significantly outperforms DT and establishes competitive performance against state-of-the-art DT variants across multiple offline RL tasks.

Abstract: The rise of live streaming has transformed online interaction, enabling massive real-time engagement but also exposing platforms to complex risks such as scams and coordinated malicious behaviors. Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid synthesis planning in chemistry, but standard prompting methods often yield hallucinated or outdated suggestions. We study LLM interactions with a reaction knowledge graph by casting reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher (natural language to graph query) generation problem, and define single- and multi-step retrieval tasks. We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present. We provide a reproducible Text2Cypher evaluation setup to facilitate further work on KG-grounded LLMs for synthesis planning. Code is available at https://github.com/Intelligent-molecular-systems/KG-LLM-Synthesis-Retrieval.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of crop above-ground biomass (AGB) under water stress is critical for monitoring crop productivity, guiding irrigation, and supporting climate-resilient agriculture. Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\%$) and computational efficiency. By combining the scalability of deep learning with the biophysical rigor of process-based modeling, AgriPINN provides a robust and interpretable framework for spatio-temporal AGB prediction, offering practical value for planning of irrigation infrastructure, yield forecasting, and climate-adaptation planning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Designing faster algorithms for solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems is highly desired across numerous practical domains, as a vast array of complex real-world challenges can be effectively modeled as MILP formulations. Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often exhibit abrupt shifts in tone and persona during extended interaction, reflecting the absence of explicit temporal structure governing agent-level state. While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.

Abstract: Climate disinformation has become a major challenge in today digital world, especially with the rise of misleading images and videos shared widely on social media. These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable. This approach improves the model ability to handle real-world climate disinformation and supports efforts to protect public understanding of science in a rapidly changing information landscape.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common in educational applications, there is a growing need for evidence-based methods to design and evaluate LLM prompts that produce personalized and pedagogically aligned out-puts. This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural theorem provers like DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 combine large language models with reinforcement learning, achieving impressive results through sophisticated training. We ask: do these highly-trained models still benefit from simple structural guidance at inference time? We evaluate a lightweight intervention -- a fixed prompt schedule over 15 common tactic skeletons -- on the miniF2F benchmark. This simple approach yields 21.7% pass@16 compared to 15.2% for standard sampling from the same model, a 43% relative improvement using the same number of samples (k=16) and same maximum generation length (1024 tokens). Our results suggest that even capable RL-trained provers underutilize structural priors available in the tactic language, and that simple inference-time guidance remains a cheap, complementary boost.

Abstract: This thesis explores the use of a General Game System (GGS) to support the automatic expansion of game boards in boardless games. Traditional implementations of such games often rely on oversized static boards defined from the start, even though large portions of these boards may never be used during gameplay. This approach leads to unnecessary complexity. To address this issue, this thesis propose a dynamic board expansion mechanism in which the game board grows automatically during play.
