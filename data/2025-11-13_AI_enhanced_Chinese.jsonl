This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data.

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur.

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts.

Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa).

We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance.

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a+\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5actor-critic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f83\u65e9\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u5224\u4e8b\u6545\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u9700\u8981\u5728\u53ca\u65f6\u9884\u8b66\u4e0e\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684actor-critic\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u6297\u566a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff1bactor-critic\u7ed3\u6784\u5229\u7528\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u5956\u52b1\u51b3\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u62a5\u8b66\u65f6\u673a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAD\u3001CCD\u3001A3D\u4e09\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u5747\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u9884\u5224\u7684\u62a5\u8b66\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations.

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAAM\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u9664\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1135%\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u964d\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5206\u4eab\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u6cc4\u9732\u76ae\u80a4\u989c\u8272\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u670d\u88c5\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757\uff08AAM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5230\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9690\u79c1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u9759\u6001\u7247\u6bb5\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5171\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5df2\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7528\uff1b\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u964d\u4f4e35%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6027\u522b\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u4e14\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary.

In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail.

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u975e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u4e0b\u4e00\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e00\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4e14\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u4ece32x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528IsoFlops\u914d\u7f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u6700\u9ad8\u52307e19 FLOPs\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u4e0b\u4e00\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u3001ImageNet\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7Fr'echet Distance\u8861\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a32x32\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5feb3\u52305\u500d\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u901f\u5ea6\u8fdc\u5feb\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\uff1b\u9884\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u74f6\u9888\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u6bcf\u5e74\u589e\u957f4\u52305\u500d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\u5fae\u8c03Stable Diffusion\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u4e25\u91cd\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u6613\u7ee7\u627f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u53d1\u8272\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u91d1\u53d1\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u5230\u5973\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u5267\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528Stable Diffusion\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u79cdStable Diffusion\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u5404\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6837\u672c\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u5355\u4e2aDreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u5dee\u5f02\u6df9\u6ca1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u56fe\u50cf\u805a\u7c7b\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c07\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acbDreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u751fStable Diffusion\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u53bb\u504f\u7b97\u6cd5Group-DRO\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eGroup-DRO\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u7fa4\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u7684Stable Diffusion\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u7c07\u5185\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u4e25\u91cd\u65f6\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9012\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53GIS\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u641c\u7d22\u89c6\u89d2\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4ee5\u6e10\u8fdb\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\uff08GIS\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\uff08RR\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u5224\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6574\u5408\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5305\u542b\u9012\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RAG\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u4f4d\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f00\u56fd\u5143\u52cb\u89d2\u8272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u65f6\u4e8b\u653f\u6cbb\u8bae\u9898\u751f\u6210\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u7531LLM\u4ef2\u88c1\u5668\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u53cc\u91cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5168\u90e8\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5f97\u520688.3\u9ad8\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u768471.7\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6846\u67b6\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9012\u5f52\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7GIS\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input.

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSiPF\u548cRIAttnConv\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94shadow\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\uff08RI\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u6784\u9020\u7684RI\u7279\u5f81\u66ff\u4ee3\u539f\u59cb\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4efb\u610f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u635f\u5931\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5de6\u53f3\u673a\u7ffc\uff09\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faShadow-informed Pose Feature\uff08SiPF\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e2d\u6d3e\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff08shadow\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8RI\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution\uff08RIAttnConv\uff09\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5c06SiPF\u878d\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u8fd8\u57fa\u4e8eBingham\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5355\u4f4d\u56db\u5143\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684shadow\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u81f4shadow\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709RI\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165SiPF\u548cRIAttnConv\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94shadow\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709RI\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u53d7\u9650\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5bf9\u79f0\u90e8\u4ef6\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u97e7\u6027\u6846\u67b6Argus\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aefADS\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fdd\u89c4\u51cf\u5c1164%\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u5347150%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9053\u8def\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u6837\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u5177\u5907\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e76\u5e94\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6Argus\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7ADS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230EGO\u8f66\u8f86\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u5757\u65e0\u7f1d\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230TCP\u3001UniAD\u548cVAD\u4e09\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aefADS\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "Argus\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347ADS\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe150.30%\uff0c\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a64.38%\uff0c\u4e14\u989d\u5916\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u9a7e\u9a76\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$.

Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \\& Eosin (H\\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B.

These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u6e90\u4e8e\u76ee\u524d\u7684agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u3001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5de5\u4e1a\uff09\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5206\u6790\u4e86agentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u4e3aAI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5c42\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u5c42\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4ee5\u5224\u65ad\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5e76\u53ca\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u56e0\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u5c42\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aagentic AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6301\u7eed\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining.

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

We propose a paradigm shift from \"model training\" to \"model raising\", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate.

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly.

Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins.

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6700\u65b0LLM\u5728PDDL\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u6df7\u6dc6\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u4ee5\u5f80\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728PDDL\u9886\u57df\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u662f\u5426\u7f29\u5c0f\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DeepSeek R1\u3001Gemini 2.5 Pro\u3001GPT-5\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u5668LAMA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5bf9\u56fd\u9645\u89c4\u5212\u7ade\u8d5b\u5b66\u4e60\u8d5b\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206PDDL\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u51c6\u9886\u57df\u548c\u7ecf\u6df7\u6dc6\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7eaf\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6PDDL\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0cGPT-5\u5728\u5df2\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4e0eLAMA\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5f53\u9886\u57df\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6df7\u6dc6\u5904\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u6709LLM\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0b\u964d\u5e45\u5ea6\u5c0f\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u76f8\u8f83\u524d\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "2025\u5e74\u7684\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5df2\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6PDDL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e5f\u6709\u6539\u5584\u3002"}}

NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Chawla"], "title": "CrochetBench: Can Vision-Language Models Move from Describing to Doing in Crochet Domain?", "comment": "code available at https://github.com/Peiyu-Georgia-Li/crochetBench", "summary": "We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Hausdorff\u7ef4\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86FGM\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08\u63d0\u534739%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4e3aFGM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eHD\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08FGM\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u96be\u70b9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u53ef\u89c6\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5206\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u7684Hausdorff\u7ef4\u6570\uff08HD\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\u5f15\u5165FGM\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684HD\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4bHD\u4ee5\u8282\u7701\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eHD\u7684\u635f\u5931\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u8c03\u52a8\u91cf\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528HD\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u9009\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5FGM-HD\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfFGM\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e8639%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06Hausdorff\u7ef4\u6570\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u5747\u5bf9FGM\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u63a8\u52a8\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use.

However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u7b7e\u540d\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u201c\u4e00\u7b7e\u4e00\u7528\u201d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8598%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u7b7e\u540d\u867d\u65b9\u4fbf\uff0c\u4f46\u5df2\u5931\u53bb\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6613\u88ab\u590d\u5236\u548c\u6ee5\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u53c8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b7e\u540d\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8c03\u6574\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u6c34\u5370\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u98ce\u683c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 AuthSig\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7535\u5b50\u7b7e\u540d\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4fe1\u606f\u9690\u542b\u5728\u7b7e\u540d\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u4e00\u7b7e\u4e00\u7528\u201d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ec6\u5fae\u8c03\u6574\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u5370\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b7e\u540d\u98ce\u683c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u57df\u53ca\u7b7e\u540d\u7279\u6709\u9000\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc7 98%\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6253\u5370-\u626b\u63cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "AuthSig \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9759\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u7b7e\u540d\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u53d6\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u73b0\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9610\u8ff0\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u516d\u5927\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u667a\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u5177\u8eab\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u9610\u8ff0\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08Physical AI\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5177\u8eab\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u516d\u5927\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff1a\u5177\u8eab\u6027\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bf4\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u7406\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c01\u95ed\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u8def\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u73b0\u610f\u4e49\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5eb7\u590d\u8bca\u6240\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u5e76\u975e\u6765\u81ea\u62bd\u8c61\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u5373\u65f6\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u4f53\u9a8c\uff1b\u516d\u5927\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e92\u76f8\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u5177\u8eab\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5230\u611f\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u8fbe\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u8282\u53ca\u60c5\u5883\u5bfc\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u5177\u8eab\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u901a\u8fc7\u8eab\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u751f\u6210\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u516d\u5927\u539f\u7406\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u6ce2\u5f62\u6269\u6563Transformer\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u4f2a\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u53ca\u5c0f\u6ce2\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8(DR)\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u7279\u5f81\u2014\u2014\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624(MA)\u5728\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u5149\u5ea6\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u5de5\u7b5b\u67e5\u8d39\u65f6\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u9ad8\u8bef\u68c0\u7387\u53ca\u6b63\u5e38\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b5b\u67e5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6ce2\u5f62\u6269\u6563Transformer\u6846\u67b6\uff08WDT-MD\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u5927\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6270\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u907f\u514d\u8eab\u4efd\u6620\u5c04\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u8865\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f02\u5e38\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563Transformer\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6b63\u5e38\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728IDRiD\u548ce-ophtha MA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWDT-MD\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WDT-MD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728MA\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u7b5b\u67e5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly.

Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAN\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eGenerative Latent Prediction (GLP) \u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9aa8\u5e72\uff08\u4f9d\u6258\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u672c\u77e5\u8bc6\u652f\u6491\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "PAN\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u53ca\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PAN\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL.

With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods.

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively.

However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes.

However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faDermBench\u4e0eDermEval\u53cc\u91cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u843d\u5730\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408DermBench\u4e0eDermEval\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002DermBench\u5305\u542b4000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u79d1\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6253\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002DermEval\u662f\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u53d9\u8ff0\u7ed9\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3001\u603b\u4f53\u5f97\u5206\u53ca\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u57284500\u4f8b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDermBench\u4e0eDermEval\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.251\u548c0.117\uff08\u6ee1\u52065\u5206\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5355\u75c5\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u516c\u5171\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u57df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0e\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u5728\u624b\u672f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u955c\u5934\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5305\u62ec\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee5\u53ca\u672f\u524dCT\u4e0e\u4f53\u5185\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f62\u53d8\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u60a3\u8005\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u57df\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u6b8b\u4f59\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9010\u5e27\u5b9e\u73b0\u672f\u4e2d\u5185\u955c\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0e\u672f\u524dCT\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u76842D-3D\u914d\u51c6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u5185\u955cRGB\u5e27\u4e0eCT\u6e32\u67d3\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u516c\u5171\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee2.65\u6beb\u7c73\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee0.19\u5f27\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9010\u5e272D-3D\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9002\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \\texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "TACO\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56de\u7b54\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u6d89\u53ca\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5e38\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5982\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u6216\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TACO\uff08Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u56de\u7b54\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u5199\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u63aa\u8f9e\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u9ed1\u76d2\uff09\u6216\u81ea\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u7070\u76d2\uff09\u805a\u5408\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7b54\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08POPE\u3001MME\u3001HallusionBench\u3001AMBER\u3001MM-Hal Bench\uff09\u53ca\u4e24\u4e2aMLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLaVA-1.5-7B \u548c CogVLM2\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTACO\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "TACO\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e13\u5bb6\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamPose3D\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u5173\u8282\u4eb2\u548c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5e27\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e76\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e00\u5e27\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u5e27\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5173\u8282\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684DreamPose3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece2D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5177\u6709\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u201c\u5e7b\u8c61\u201d\u59ff\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Human3.6M\u548cMPI-3DHP\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5404\u9879\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u5e7f\u64ad\u68d2\u7403\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ea6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u57282D\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6839\u636e\u52a8\u4f5c\u610f\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamPose3D\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality.

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors.

PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFQ-PETR\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408QFPE\u3001DULUT\u4e0eQANS\u4e09\u9879\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728W8A8\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u964d1%\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d75%\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f8\u673a\u591a\u89c6\u89d23D\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709PETR\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u867d\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5374\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8ePETR\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u5c04\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e45\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5316\u7684FQ-PETR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u5927\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u7684LiDAR\u5c04\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\uff08QFPE\uff09\uff1a\u7528LiDAR\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5355\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u951a\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u66ff\u4ee3\u591a\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u5229\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e76\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff1b2\uff09\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08DULUT\uff09\uff1a\u7528\u4e24\u7ea7\u7ebf\u6027\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\uff1b3\uff09\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u540e\u7684\u91cf\u5316\uff08QANS\uff09\uff1a\u5728softmax\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u540e\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u8f93\u5165\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5931\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u5728PETRs\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff08PETR\u3001StreamPETR\u3001PETRv2\u3001MV2d\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cFQ-PETR\u5728W8A8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d\u7ea61%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe75%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u548cQAT\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FQ-PETR\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PETR\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a763D\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "OUGS\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u76843DGS\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D Gaussian Splatting\uff083DGS\uff09\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4e0a\u5df2\u8fbe\u5230\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u7279\u5b9a\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6613\u53d7\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOUGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u5143\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u901a\u8fc7\u6e32\u67d3\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u5f97\u5230\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOUGS\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473DGS\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u6574\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "OUGS\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89d2\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u517c\u5177\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u63a8\u51fa\u7f8e\u5f0f\u6a44\u6984\u7403\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff08MOT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u65e5\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u4f53\u80b2\u9879\u76ee\uff08\u5982\u8db3\u7403\u3001\u7bee\u7403\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u7f8e\u5f0f\u6a44\u6984\u7403\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u56e0\u906e\u6321\u9891\u7e41\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u63a5\u89e6\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5374\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u7f8e\u5f0f\u6a44\u6984\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62e5\u6324\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0e\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ddf\u8e2a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u7f8e\u5f0f\u6a44\u6984\u7403\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2dViT\u9ad8\u8017\u3001CNN\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528ViT\u548cCNN\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\uff0cViT\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u53ef\u5c06ViT\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7ed9CNN\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5f3aCNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f02\u6784ViT\u6559\u5e08\u4e0e\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u5b66\u751f\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1)\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6559\u5e08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b(2)\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u4f4d\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u6a21\u4effViT\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728HMDB51\u3001EPIC-KITCHENS-100\u548cKinetics-400\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728HMDB51\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53475.95%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u4e0e\u540c\u6784\u6559\u5e08\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
