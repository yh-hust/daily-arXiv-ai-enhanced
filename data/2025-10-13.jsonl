As a working baseline, we\nadopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using\nSAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability\nbackbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.\n  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts\nfrom our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:\nclassification exploits \"Elsewhere\" concepts that fire everywhere except on\ntarget objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary\ndetectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct\nmonocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.\n  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of\nthe concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense\nrather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence\nand departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an\nimage, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after\nremoving position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond\nlinear sparsity alone.\n  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed\nby combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown\namong colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'\nconceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces\nsums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce\nthe Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical\nsignatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer\nrepresentations."}

To determine if our model's\nartificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct\nsituations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and\nlogical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and\nthe final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier\nclassification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and\nqualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated\nconsciousness, although the difference in response between different characters\nand consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed\nmodels incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead\nto building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid\nconsciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for\nimproving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts."}

Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and\nICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or\nrobustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to\nenable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and\nabstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues\nand years."}

This paper\naims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by\ntackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and\nlabor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of\neffective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to\nindividual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that\nintegrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware\nmodeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden\nthe all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using\na task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video\nscenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising\napproximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While\nspecialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for\nevaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by\nmanually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive\ntraining with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the\npotential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a\nspatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses\nscale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,\nextensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,\ndemonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across\nall scales and scenarios.

By integrating action modules into these\npretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,\ntraining them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet\neffective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution\ncapability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our\narchitecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token\nand a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action\nknowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform\nlightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the\nsmall action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder\nand avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the\nlanguage model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to\nintegrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the\naction token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future\nactions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics\nnot captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains\nover training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous\nstate-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on\nLIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In\nreal-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently\noutperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),\nwhich demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate\nprecise actions while substantially reducing training costs."}

Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as\nthey either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant\nrecomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for\nreal-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input.
